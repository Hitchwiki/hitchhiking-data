We stopped there on our way from Paris to Berlin and got a car directly to Berlin after 45 minutes of waiting. The traffic was quite intense, a great stop and not hard to reach with transportation.

Please just note: To get to the gas station you have to cross (illegaly) a field. On rainy days (so was mine) you may look dirty and full of mud. Well, I had to change my clothes, otherwise nobody would have taken me :D

―Anonymous, December 2014

Why cross a field, when there´s a road to each side of the service-area? I saw also someone crossing the motorway by foot to go on the other side but there´s a tunnel a little bit south which you can easy reach by foot.

―Anonymous, March 2015

Good place when heading to Bremen (A1) or Hannover (A2).
To get there from Schwerte train station, take bus no. R50 to \""Lichtendorf Poetschke\"". From there you can already see the service area.

I waited only a few minutes, there was much traffic. Only problem: There is a fence around the station, so maybe you have to climb. But that’s no big deal.
To come here take the train “RB 25 from the cologne main station in the direction “Marienheide or “Overath for 3,20 €. Leave at “Stümpen and turn right and go up to the “Kiefernweg and turn right. Follow the street that is later called “Dammelsfurther Weg up to the “Pestalozziweg for maybe 500 meters and turn right. Now you pass the Autobahn and turn right again in the “Plantage. Follow this way a few hundred meters through the forest and you will see a service station on the right side. Maybe you have to climb a fence. Now you are on the a station without oil station but much traffic. Easy to get a ride here. Totally it takes approximately 40 minutes from the cologne main station. In my experience this is the best possibility to leave cologne.

Quite a lot of traffic Wednesday around 10:15 in the morning. Got a ride to the gas station at the A3 before Frankfurt after around 20 minutes.

Went hiking through the woods (which is apparently a minefield, but got marked paths, signs saying you shouldn't stray off the paths. The fence around the gas station is around 2m, probably not too difficult to climb, but is pointy on the top, and it looks fairly difficult to climb over and look casual.

There's is a loose down corner on the fence right before the station, so if one happen to be a very small dog or a cat that could also work. I think the best place to climb over is on the side  before the station, it's a bit more hidden and clearly a lot of people have climbed over there before.

Easiest way to get to Maastricht is to find a driver going to Belgium or Eindhoven over the A76 in the Netherlands, then get out at A76 exit Geleen and hitch with sign Maastricht.

To get to Maastricht you can also find here any driver going to Heerlen-Eindhoven-Antwerpen, after crossing the border let the driver take the exit N281. Parallel road, the N281 has an exit Maastricht (with a petrol station at the beginning of the A79!). Then driver goes on on N281 towards his destination.

This is a great rest stop but quite hard to get to, Best to get a lift from one of the on ramps of the A3 and ask to be taken 15km to Siegburg Raststätte. this is well worth the effort as there is lots of traffic and I got a lift in 20 minutes to Wurzburg and then onwards to Nurnburg.

ps, careful hitching to this rest stop, I mistakedly help up a board for Siegburg Bahnhof and got dropped off at the station about 3-4km away, a irritating walk through the town. I quickly learned that German word and also Raststätte means rest stop.

This place for whatever reason gave me no luck at all. I got there late and camped overnight, the next day it was raining.

I followed the instruction on the main page for Cologne and caught the Tram U9 to Königsforst, then after looking at the map at the train station there walked about 1km to the onramp, found an ok place to hitch from and held up a sign for the Siegburg Bahnhof - only later did I realise my error, I should have written Siegburg Raststätte, to get dropped off at the rest stop about 15km south along the A3.

on ramp of the A3 to frankfurt. cars can stop easily here. average waiting (male) time: 1hour or less. if you get a ride just to rasthof siegburg, take it.

On-ramp that works okay enough, was little traffic at 10 am on a Wednesday, which probably was a benefit. There is a breakdown lane where the cars can stop, and it's decent enough for being an onramp.  Got a car to Königsforst Raststätte after fifteen minutes. 

Definitely better than having to climb the pointy fence at the gas station.

Having hitchhiked via Frechen very often I don't like this place. There is always lots of local traffic going to the restaurant here. The fuel station is barely frequented.

Sliproad to the motorway. Average waiting time 30-60 minutes. Not a very bad spot, but there are better ones nearby. For more info, see http://www.hitchwiki.org/Köln
