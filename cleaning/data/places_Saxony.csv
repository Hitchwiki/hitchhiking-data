Last rest area before Leipzig and Halle, so the place to change cars if your driver goes to those cities.

All new and shiny now (2010), so the second marker talking about closure is obsolete should be removed/updated. Ask people, took us 3min, lots of license plates from Hanover area there.

my fav in dd (i live around the corner)! i hitchhiked very often to berlin from here. i waited from 1 minute (sunny weather) til 30 minute (heavy snowing). i often stand before the shell petrol station, but asking the drivers direcly at the petrol station is also a good idea. it's also a good starting point for going to leipzig, chemnitz and further west and south (bavaria, austria, italy, france, spain). you should ask for the raststätte dresdner tor near wilsdruff. there you can change the car easily.

After 10 min. late in the afternoon, whether was not very good a car stopped and strait to Prague. The girl that was driving was caring two people that were carpooling and one was going to Prague and I when at the same hostel(I didm't have one) and the driver brought us AT the hostel in the center of Prague seriously she waled in the hostel with us!!

to get to praha (prague, prag) on autobahn 'A 17' this is a good spot. you can stand underneath (or in front of-) the tall blue 'PIRNA - PRAHA' sign on 'B 170'. there is a curbside where the road bends onto the autobahn's on ramp, it is safe (legal) to stand there also safe for drivers to stop on the mentioned (cobbled) sliproad. you will know what i mean if you see it. to get there you can take the ??? bus from the city center which stops only a few hundred meters away or walk for around 30 minutes from the dresden DB main station via 'fritz-löffler straße', 'bergstraße', 'innsbrucker straße' and  'possendorfer straße' (do not follow 'innsbrucker straße' all its way but shortcut through 'kaitz' village). there is a noise protection wall between 'possendorfer straße' and 'B 170' but don't worry, there are doors to open in the wall. don't miss the view on elbsandsteingebirge from the B 170 bridge over the autobahn. on my personal ranking ""1"" (very-very poor) to ""10"" (excellent) i will rate this spot a ""7 to 8"".

I didn't have a sign, and one of these took me to Dresden - the rest were just going to the next town.

It took me one hour to get away from this place, not because it's not a good one but because I started at 7pm on a week day... so the station was pretty empty and I needed to ask the drivers personnaly. But I did find someone who left me just before Berlin.

―Yooks (Hitchwiki), May 2015

before my rating this spot had a very good no it is only good ... i think it is an ok place and I got a lift within in 15minutes... but I think it is far from perfect mainly because there are not many cars stopping at the station and it is not legal to hitch on the road so if nobody pulls up you are screwed. but generally speaking I am sure you get a ride from here :) just not a 100% perfect spot

Took me quite a long time to get there from Hauptbahnhof (train main station), because I took S-Bahn 15, then Bus and walked about 30 min more. Nevertheless probably the best spot to get a ride towards West, I found a driver who took me to Rastplatz Rhonetal after some 15 min already.

―Anonymous, September 2015

For Chemnitz and the center of Leipzig, this is a very good spot. But for Kassel/ Göttingen we waited 1,5 hours. It was the thrid car to head this destination in this period of time. The journey from Leipzig took us very long as well. Pack some food and a good load of time for this one. 

―Anonymous, August 2017

Average rest area with just a WC. From my point of view a very good spot to get from Leipzig to any westbound destination. For near and easy things like Kassel or Gttingen or more advantageous aims like Southern Netherlands or Northern France this could be a gould start. The A 38 is from my experience a good connection to the west: very few congestions but still enough traffic to get away.

How to get there:
Take a train from Leipzig Central Station to Liebertwolkwitz Station (takes 15mins) and then just walk there (takes 20-30 mins) via ""Gropsnaer Strae"". Important note: This section of the Autobahn is fenced like many others. To finally acces the Rastplatz you either need to climb the fence (quite manageable) or bring tools.
As soon as I reached the area, I had a lift within 15 mins in sunday calm traffic.

It's perfect spot in order to leave Dresden towards east. It's quite possible to find a car directly to Prague as well as to Pirna.

This spot is ok for leaving Dresden. If you want to go to Prague, don't be late. Lot's of cars are taking long distances mornings. There is not any Petrol Station. There is just toilets. It's also quite ok for camping if you arrive there so late. good luck ;)

a perfect (!) spot to leave 'leipzig' to 'dresden' or other places in eastern saxony. the 'paunsdorf center' (the roofed area you see below the marker) is a large shopping mall with excellent public transportation opportunities (tram, bus, even late at night) to the leipzig city center. it took me 30 seconds (!!!) to find a driver taking me on autobahn 'A 14' in the direction of 'dresden'. it is not legal (!) or safe (no shoulder) to stand between here and the 'A 14' on the federal highway 'B 6'. on my personal ranking ""1"" (very-very poor) to ""10"" (excellent) i will rate this spot a ""9"".

If you get stuck here, your best bet is to take a train to Zwickau or Chemnitz, or try your luck on the A4/B93 junction. As I was on the way to Poland and my driver did a 50km detour to here (all the way from the A9) because he was sure that dropping me off at Meerane's McDonalds was a good idea. He shouldn't have bothered. For more info, see http://www.hitchwiki.org/Meerane
