       "      <td>Great spot for hitching north from Anchorage; have done it many times. Usually get to Wasilla, sometimes Willow and other times as far as Denali National Park. There is a little bus pullout right on the highway after the stop light. Many people are just starting to speed up, but not always going too fast, so you should get a ride if you look good. I would suggest a sign here.</td>\n",

It is located in direction towards north- no point for driver heading south to stop here. I got there only because my driver had his destination here. So I took a chance. Instead of asking people I thumbed next to the road at a crossroad. Very dangerous spot! Speed limit 80km/h, barely no space to pulling over, difficult for drivers to read your sign. Good visibility at least. However I got a ride in just 5min. Crazy girl took me to Gävle. Never again!</td>\n",

Then walk from the station in Moshkovo to the highway 2.5 km. The point is located right at the exit from the Gazprom gas station. There is also a traffic light on the highway in front of the gas station, so every 2 minutes the flow of cars and trucks stops completely and starts picking up speed again. The highway in this place is 2-lane.

Estas polica haltejo antaŭe, do ĉiuj eniras malrapide. Mi estis bonŝanca, ke ili iris tre malproksimen. Mi povus esti elirinta pli frue kaj daŭriginta pli rapide, ĉar ili haltis multfoje por ŝarĝi kaj ankaŭ kiam cementkamiono renversiĝis sur la vojo, ili petis min helpon por porti la restaĵojn de cemento, kiuj restis sur la vojo, kiujn ni forigis el la kamiono kaj transportis per biciklo tuj post la pesilo, ĉar la kamionisto loĝis tuj post ĝi. Fine, ĉar ni alvenis malfrue nokte, preskaŭ je la unua horo matene, ili proponis al mi lokon por dormi, dankon multe.   \n",

Usually get to Wasilla, sometimes Willow and other times as far as Denali National Park. There is a little bus pullout right on the highway after the stop light. Many people are just starting to speed up, but not always going too fast, so you should get a ride if you look good. I would suggest a sign here.   \n",

Also, cars are pulling into the bus stop all the time to unload or do whatever, blocking it for you. After 90 minutes a friendly local gave me a ride to after the bridge, and dropped me at the much better spot there. You would be much better off starting there.    \n",

There's a space where cars can pull over, and luckily for me, the first car pulled over going straight to where I need to go. It's only useful if you're going north/east out of Kochi.   \n",

This is no good for going west.\\r\\nTo get into here by foot, you'll have to jump the fence, or if you're lucky like me, the backdoor was open :)   \n",

As a white young guy I waited around 90 minutes. Some people from the townships were hitching as well and got rides quicker. Don't forget to visit the township of storms river. White people will say it is dangerous but all the people were lovely. Don't be afraid!!   \n",

I did that on the southern side with the park/garden whatever since nobody will see you. But be careful cause there are some highway cameras after you jump, I'd say stick close to the side of the road and move fast. I went straight to the bathroom for some 10 mins just in case, then the hitchhiking went pretty smoothly, big time traffic. I was going to Tokushima, some guy going to southern Kyushu picked me up all the way. \\r\\nEasy spot, kinda annoying that it's locked and you gotta jump but tbh it's an easy jump, just be careful there's some weird soil mixed with grass around the fence which can suck your feet in. \\r\\nI got all on video on my yt channel @PolyglotAbroad if you need a demo.   \n",

We stood just before the petrol station. It worked well as people are slowing down because of the lights and can pull in to the petrol station easily if they want to pick you up. Staff also let us use the toilet there.   \n",

This spot is recomended on hitchwiki as a good option for rides south. I´d say it a really bad spot. There is a self-service gas station and a restaurant. It is located in direction towards north- no point for driver heading south to stop here. I got there only because my driver had his destination here. So I took a chance. Instead of asking people I thumbed next to the road at a crossroad. Very dangerous spot! Speed limit 80km/h, barely no space to pulling over, difficult for drivers to read your sign. Good visibility at least. However I got a ride in just 5min. Crazy girl took me to Gävle. Never again!   \n",

A lady denied me a ride but offered 20euros instead :D I denied them went to sleep in nearby forest. Morning I was asking around for about an hour. Quite many locals. Than moved to thumb on the on ramp. After 10min i got a ride to STHLM.   \n",

Easy to reach by underground. If you prefer to ask people you can do that at gas station. But it seem mostly Stockholmers stop there. I thumbed at  on ramp with a sign simply saying SOUTH for about 30min. Good visibility, high traffic, low speed, quite little space to pull over (but who wants to take you can always manage). I took a ride with very nice fellow hitchhiker to Norrköping. Which I do not recomend if Norrköping is not your destination- not a good town to transfer I think.    \n",

       "59255  Stopover point to the east of Novosibirsk. You can get there by train (eastbound, to Moshkovo or Bolotnoye). Local website for suburban trains \"express prigorod\", a ticket from the central station costs 126 rubles, $ 1.3. From Gagarinskaya 110 rubles, metro and suburban train stop. Then walk from the station in Moshkovo to the highway 2.5 km. The point is located right at the exit from the Gazprom gas station. There is also a traffic light on the highway in front of the gas station, so every 2 minutes the flow of cars and trucks stops completely and starts picking up speed again. The highway in this place is 2-lane. I left here 2 times in 10 and 15 minutes, respectively.\\r\\nThe best point for entering and exiting Novosibirsk from this side (in my opinion). 30 kilometers from Novosibirsk the highway becomes 4-lane, near the northern bypass you can stand for an hour trying to catch a car to the center of Novosibirsk, and not a transit one.   \n",

One guy did pullover but wouldnt talk to me, he just looked at me dumbly, rubbed his fingers wanting money and drove off. I also had one A hole who did the fake pullover then acellerate off laughing like a total twat. I changed spots and got picked up eventually, but again, 3 hours in a good spot with tons of slow traffic is ridiculous. Hopefully it'll be better for you.   \n",
