If you are not successful, just ask the people refueling their cars at the gas station. But I think, that you mostly get your lift after at least 20 minuts, since the people in that area are not really used to seeing hitchhikers on that way. \\n\\n\\u2015Anonymous, May 2013&quot;, 25.0, NaN], [52.793962528645, 13.233489227046, 4.0, &quot;&quot;, NaN, NaN], [52.75295262222127, 12.854051879147747, 4.0, &quot;good spot northbound\\n\\n\\u2015Johnjomowfen (Hitchwiki), October 2012\\n\\nI`ve got the feeling that this place is better than the following gasoline stations on the A24 in direction to Hamburg.

My fastest lift was straight to berlin in 5min, and the longest I had to wait 1:30h-2h something like that. My best experience is to only show your thumb, people will stop and you can ask them where they go. Signs like \\&quot;Berlin\\&quot; or \\&quot;Direction Berlin\\&quot; will only confuse them, since they think they can only take you if they go directly to Berlin.\\n\\n\\u2015Yorick (Hitchwiki), May 2014\\n\\nAugust 2014.

My fastest lift was straight to berlin in 5min, and the longest I had to wait 1:30h-2h something like that. My best experience is to only show your thumb, people will stop and you can ask them where they go.
