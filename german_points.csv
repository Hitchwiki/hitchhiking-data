We went here in the evening and a parking lot was filled with trucks.
A lot of traffic on a station. Mostly going direction Bayreuth-Hof and than Berlin or Dresden and Poland. Quite a lot going Pasau-Graz-Maribor. Some going Pasau-Wien-Budapest. Few going to Prague.

We asked truckers about tomorrow morning. We found one going to Prague in 6am. But I was in a rush.

Shortly after exit 54, Großburgwedel at 52.504431, 9.824794, you can get off and go over a bridge to a resting area for cars going south. There it is easier to find a car heading towards east.

15-16:40 12.8.2015

We got here on a way from Metz dir. Nürnberg.
Petrol station with a big parking for trucks, McDonald with parking for cars. A shop is nearby. All the complex is vast.
Not a best place, as there is a lot of locals and the station itself is a bit far away /2 roundabouts) from A6 highway.
A lot of locals and trucks going to Strasbourg (surprisingly).

In one hour a german driver Herbert agreed to take us to Nürnberg. He couldn t speak other language, so I had to practise german (good!). When he was having a shower, we talked, ate and drunk with Hamid, a Persian driver (with very few english he knew and few Turkish words I remember). It was a wonderful communication. He wanted to marry Nicol, but than we went away to Herbert's car.",2015-08-13 19:35:39.000000,1,0,,,,POINT (8.183514118194438 49.553402121651395)

Reasons: IKEA is just behind the spot and hence there are many people from all over the place to buy some furniture. This can also cause problems, when they are totally loaded.
How to get there:
Take either tram line no. 4 or 5 to station 'Huckelriede' then switch over into bus line no. 53 until the end (IKEA) or station 'Carl-Zeiss-Str.'
(one earlier). Be aware that you leave the city boarders, when using Bus 53. You'll need an area-extension if you don't want to dodge the fare.

Take a train from Leipzig Central Station to Liebertwolkwitz Station (takes 15mins) and then just walk there (takes 20-30 mins) via ""Großpösnaer Straße"".

-Stand at the traffic lights. Lights are set so usually 5-6 cars stop at the red light, go through and then the next 5-6 cars have to stop. Plenty of time for them to decide if they want to give you a ride or not. Only thing here is that you have to pick one side so you miss a few cars.

OR

(Going South only)
-Stand behind the intersection right before the start of the highway. There's a spot where people can pull up. Thing here is that people are accelerating right where you stand (not so good).
