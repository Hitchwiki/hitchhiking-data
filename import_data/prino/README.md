Hitchhiking records of [Robert Prins](https://prino.neocities.org) who recorded his trips throughout his life and achieved a Guinness World Record for hitchhiking.

`raw.ods` > `rides.csv` as a tabular representation of all rides is obtained from [his website](https://prino.neocities.org/miscellaneous/keeping-statistics).

`description.html` is a dump of [his website](https://prino.neocities.org/miscellaneous/keeping-statistics) describing how to read `raw.ods`.

`routes.dat` is quite similart to [this one](https://prino.neocities.org/resources/liftdat.rar) but contains routes and is anonymized. It is obtained from Prins privatelly.
