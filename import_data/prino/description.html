<h1>Keeping statistics - one way of doing it</h1>
  <p>So you want to keep track of your rides and, once you’ve managed to get safely back home,
     do something “useful” with the data you’ve collected? If yes, read on…

  </p><p>This work-in-progress page is based on the notes Prino has used since he started recording his
     rides on 16&nbsp;June 1980 at 7:47. The notes are pretty simple; you can obviously adapt them to
     your own requirements.

</p><h3>A possible form to record data</h3>
  <p></p><figure class="main">

       <figcaption>Prino’s liftnote</figcaption>
     </figure>
     The forms Prino uses to record his data look like this, and, properly spaced, you can put three
     columns with four rows on a sheet of A4 (210x297mm) paper. Fitting three columns on a US
     “Letter” size sheet (215.9x279.4mm) of paper might be possible if the column widths are
     reduced. Prino saves his notes in 17-ring binders.

  </p><p>The key to the detail of the produced statistics is the <b>Opmerkingen</b> section. It’s
     simply called <b>Opmerkingen</b>, as you are unlikely to add specific comments to all of
     your rides…

  </p><p>For those of you who don’t want to go to the trouble of creating the forms yourselves? There are
     ready-made versions available <a href="https://prino.neocities.org/miscellaneous/hitchtech.html#hitchnotes">here</a>, and on that page you can
     also find some additional “technical” hitchhiking resources.

</p><h4>The fields</h4>
  <p>What follows is a description of the various fields on the above form. There is one field that
     might seem to be missing, “Waiting Time,” but it should be obvious that it’s automagically
     included as the difference between the arrival time of one ride and the departure time of the
     next ride, and in those cases where something happens in between, the <b>Opmerkingen</b>
     section comes to the rescue.

</p><h5>Datum (Date)</h5>
  <p>Pretty obvious.

  </p><p>If you use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601" target="_blank">ISO 8601</a>
     format (YYYY-MM-DD), it’s easy to extend this to rides spanning multiple days by modifying
     the format to YYYY-MM-DD/DD.

</p><h5>Vertrek (Departure) / Aankomst (Arrival)</h5>
  <p>Again, pretty obvious.

  </p><p>The three columns contain the Tijd (Time), KM-stand (Odometer) and Plaats (Location) of
     departure and arrival. In cases where no odometer is available or where it doesn’t work, you
     can use <a href="https://maps.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Maps</a> to determine distances.
     Prino has found that it is usually accurate to the nearest kilometre.

  </p><p>The unnamed row below “Aankomst” contains the total time and distance of the ride.

</p><h5>Snelheid (Speed)</h5>
  <p>The contents of this field depends on individual preferences. Prino puts the real speed in
     it, i.e. the distance divided by the <strong>actual</strong> driving time, which is the
     arrival time minus the departure time <strong>minus</strong> any time recorded for stops.

</p><h5>Opmerkingen (Miscellaneous notes)</h5>
  <p>This is a free-format field that you can use for any purpose you like. Why free format?
     Easy! It’s unlikely that you would need a specific format for all of your rides, e.g. why
     include specific headings for rides that cross borders or span more than one day, when the
     number of such rides is likely to be pretty small compared to “normal” rides.

  </p><p>Here’s a non-exhaustive list of things Prino has been using this field for:

  </p><ul class="disc">
   <li>The type of driver. (Male, female, truck, van, taxi, etc, you can obviously make it as
       detailed as you like)

   </li><li>The nationality of the driver, Prino uses the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_license_plate_codes" target="_blank">international license plate code</a>,
       but only records this information if the driver is not from the country where they pick him up.

   </li><li>Details of stops (reason: meal, rest, toilet, etc) and times. Recording these times
       allows you to calculate the true driving speed!

   </li><li>Details (i.e. time and odometer reading) at border crossings, which allow you to create
       per-country totals.

   </li><li>Odometer readings at midnight, which allows you to create per-calendar-day totals.

   </li><li>Special vehicles (or even every type/model of vehicle/car).

   </li><li>On the last ride of a day Prino adds a “Total distance/time/speed” entry.
  </li></ul>

  <p>There are probably lots of other things <strong>you</strong> might want to put into it.

  </p><p>If the <b>Opmerkingen</b> section is too small (and Prino has had rides with a dozen stops and
     crossing five borders in two days), he usually continues on the back of the form.
     <!-- - see the two samples somewhere on this page. -->

</p><h3>Storing the data on a PC or other device</h3>
  <p>This is likely to be the most important decision you will have to make. There are (at least)
     three options:

  </p><ol>
   <li>a (structured) text file, to be processed by a user-written program
   </li><li>a spreadsheet
   </li><li>a database
  </li></ol>

  <p>Each of these options has its pros and cons. Here are some details:

</p><h4>Text file</h4>
  <p>Prino uses the text file option with a few programs he has written himself. The advantage of
     using this format is the fact that it allows him total flexibility, but it has a pretty big
     disadvantage in that you have to think very carefully about the format you plan to use: it
     should be able to cater for future changes without you having to completely rewrite your
     programs. The format used by Prino, described later, was developed over about 28 years, and
     despite the fact that he has moved to a new format after a few years, the result of not
     giving the format enough thought initially, is rather cryptic due to more additions since
     adopting it!

</p><h4>A spreadsheet</h4>
  <p>If you’re well versed in spreadsheets (or if not, try <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/" target="_blank">LibreOffice</a>,
     it’s free), you might want to consider using one to process your data. It will have the big
     advantage that you can insert or delete columns in your source data, and the program will
     automagically update the references in all other cells and/or sheets. Combined with the
     many conditional functions, you should (probably) be able to produce any statistics
     <strong>you</strong> like, although some of the more esoteric ones Prino’s program creates
     might be pretty hard (or even impossible, but never say never) to replicate.

  </p><p>If you want to use Prino’s input file format as described below, but would also like to use
     a spreadsheet to generate tables that <span class="pas">lift</span> doesn’t generate, you can
     use <span class="pas">dat2csv</span> to generate “lift.csv”, which contains a reduced,
     information about country- and day-splits, and in-ride stops is removed, subset of the data
     in “lift.dat”.

  </p><p>A LibreOffice “Calc” spreadsheet you might use as a starting point, but which heavily relies
     on the format of the input file used by Prino, is
     <a href="https://prino.neocities.org/resources/lift%20&amp;%20v100+.ods" target="_blank">lift&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;v100+.ods</a>.

</p><h4>A database</h4>
  <p>What was written about spreadsheets also holds true for databases. Not having used any PC
     database programs, Prino cannot recommend any, but there are plenty of free ones: LibreOffice
     “Base” and <a href="https://mariadb.com/" target="_blank">MariaDB</a>, to name just two of the
     more well-known ones. Creating your statistics will mean writing queries (most likely in the
     fairly easy-to-learn language SQL), but given the non-procedural nature of this language, some
     results that can be created with a self-written program or a spreadsheet may be hard or even
     impossible to recreate.

</p><h3>Prino’s original program</h3>
  <p>As mentioned above, and being a programmer by profession, Prino selected the first method of
     storing the data, a text file. The first 60(!) versions of his program were written in
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal" target="_blank">Turbo Pascal</a>
     (V3.01a), and until about version 20 they used “Version&nbsp;I” of a simple
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values" target="_blank">CSV file</a>
     with the data. It could handle rides passing through multiple countries and spanning more
     than one day, but did not know anything about ferry crossings, stops, or time zones, to name
     but a few of the things that arrived later…

  </p><p>Given that the old format became obsolete a long time ago, it’s not interesting to go into
     the nitty-gritty of it, but its output mimic’ed his manually created
     <a href="https://prino.neocities.org/miscellaneous/5-tables.html">five tables</a> per trip, containing:

  </p><ul class="disc">
   <li>a table with the distribution of the distances per ride. Initially in intervals of
       100&nbsp;km, but due to the overwhelming number of rides shorter than 100&nbsp;km, this
       interval was soon split up into four additional intervals of 25&nbsp;km, and the, as
       expected, rather small number of rides over 1,000&nbsp;km long are split into intervals
       of 1,000&nbsp;km.
   </li><li>a table of distances for each type of driver.
   </li><li>a table of distances per country.
   </li><li>a table with a count of the number of drivers per nationality.
   </li><li>a table with various maxima, minima, and averages for the rides and days of the trip, i.e.
       highest/lowest/average speed per ride/day, greatest/smallest/average distance per
       ride/day, longest/shortest/average time per ride/day.
  </li></ul>

  <p>Simple, uncomplicated, and one might assume that most hitchhikers would leave it at this…

</p><h3>Prino’s current program</h3>
  <p>The <a href="https://prino.neocities.org/miscellaneous/pascal.html">current program</a> is written in Virtual Pascal V2.1.279 (or
     PL/I, should you want to run it on IBM’s z/OS). It is licensed under the provisions of the
     <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank">GPL V3</a>. The
     “authenticity” verified <a href="https://www.rarlab.com/" target="_blank">WinRAR</a> archive
     containing the sources and executable files can be found as
     “<a href="https://prino.neocities.org/resources/lift32bit.rar" title="The password for this archive is “lift”">lift32bit.rar</a>”.

</p><h4 id="data">Data format used by Prino’s current program</h4>
  <p>The “simple” format was used until the end of 1994. Due to the fact that Prino wanted to add
     some additional statistics to the output files, it was changed into something a bit more
     logical, although some people might find otherwise. (And they are right, it’s a right-royal
     mess due to more additional requirements, and Prino would like to simplify some of the more
     esoteric uses of punctuation, but that’s unlikely to happen anytime soon as he has a list
     of additional tables he would like to add first)

  </p><p>The current format, split into two parts to avoid scrolling, looks like this:

  </p><p><span style="font-family: monospace; white-space: pre; font-weight: bold;">

                Of course it would be possible to add way more “type” of driver types, Prino has
                mentally reserved at least one new category, “Old”, which will come in use if he
                ever gets another ride in an oldtimer, the “Lagonda LG45” from 1937 has currently
                been classified as a Cabrio.
              </p><p>
                or

            </p></li><li>the type of “in-ride” wait, an exclamation (“!”) mark followed by three
                characters. Free format, but at the moment all descriptions are hardcoded in
                the program.

              <p>
                The “in-ride” waits just came into existence when they occurred, and although many
                of them made sense at the time, two of them, “!V” and “!N” should probably have been
                merged right from the start, and a third, “!T”, has become irrelevant since the
                arrival of the electronic tachograph.

  <p id="notes"><b>Notes:</b>

  </p><p id="distsign"><span class="stat-tt">&nbsp;[1]</span> Prino uses
     <a href="https://unece.org/DAM/trans/conventn/Distsigns.pdf">Distinguishing Signs used on Vehicles in International Traffic</a> (<a href="https://prino.neocities.org/www/pdf/2012%20-%20distsigns.pdf">Local copy</a>) <!-- https://unece.org/distinguishing-signs-vehicles -->
     and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_vehicle_registration_codes">List of international vehicle registration codes</a>
     on Wikipedia. Due the fact that three of these have changed since Prino encountered them for the first time, he still uses <b>“GB”</b> for Great-Britain,
     <b>“SF”</b> for Finland, and <b>“ROU”</b> for Uruguay, rather than the current “UK”, “FIN”, and “UY”.

  </p><p><span class="stat-tt">&nbsp;[2]</span> Given that Prino has never encountered a triple crossing
      with a backward moving time zone (e.g. F-GB at midnight), he doesn’t expect the program to
      handle them and, as yet, has no interest to test hypothetical cases. (And don’t even think
      about quadruple(!?) crossings)

  </p><p><span class="stat-tt">&nbsp;[3]</span> Prino never records the waiting time before the first
     ride of the day, unless the first ride of the day happens to be one that continues directly
     after the last ride of the previous day, without any intervening (sleep?) stop.

  </p><p><span class="stat-tt">&nbsp;[4]</span> The normal “.” separator in the waiting time must be
     replaced by a “<strong>:</strong>” (colon) for those waits caused by the departure from a
     ferry terminal where you haven’t been able to get a ride on the ferry (and may have had to
     wait until the next ferry…)

  </p><p><span class="stat-tt">&nbsp;[5]</span> Multiple split lines may be present, but they <strong>must</strong>
     be grouped, and the groups must be in “#”, “*”, “!” order!

  </p><p><span class="stat-tt">&nbsp;[6]</span> The normal “.” separator in the departure time must be
     replaced by
     </p><ul class="disc">
       <li>a “<strong>:</strong>” (<em>colon</em>) for departures after a ferry crossing in order to record the ferry crossing, or
       </li><li>a <em>uppercase</em> “<strong>X</strong>” for departures from a same-named location at the other side of the road, or
       </li><li>an <em>lowercase</em> “<strong>x</strong>” for departures from a different-named location at the other side of the road.
     </li></ul>

  <p><span class="stat-tt">&nbsp;[7]</span> Non-stopping (i.e. drive-through) border crossings must not record
     an arrival time, unless the time zone changes.

  </p><p><span class="stat-tt">&nbsp;[8]</span> The normal “.” separator in the arrival time of a time-zone-changing border crossing must be
     replaced by
     </p><ul class="disc">
       <li>a “<strong>+</strong>” for a crossing in easterly direction, and
       </li><li>a “<strong>-</strong>” for a crossing in westerly direction.
     </li></ul>

  <p><span class="stat-tt">&nbsp;[9]</span> The places of departure and arrival must be UTF-8 encoded
     and their length is (currently) limited to 47 <em>bytes</em>!

  </p><p><span class="stat-tt">[10]</span> Lines <strong>must not contain trailing blanks</strong>, but completely blank
     lines, consisting of just a CR/LF, are allowed.

  </p><p><span class="stat-tt">[11]</span> Although the data is in CSV format, all positions are fixed!

  </p><p><span class="stat-tt">[12]</span> Lines starting with “<strong>{</strong>” in column 1 are treated
     as comments or meta-data. A description of the meta-date format can be found below.

  </p><p><span class="stat-tt">[13]</span> Columns containing numerical data or times must be right aligned,
      columns containing text must be left aligned, and if the textual data is shorter than the column width,
      the separating comma may follow it without intervening blanks, except for the departure location.

  </p><p><span class="stat-tt">[14]</span> The <span class="stat-tt">“Odometer”</span> data is (currently)
     completely ignored by the main <span class="pas">lift</span> program.

  </p><p><span class="stat-tt">[15]</span> Lines longer than 255 characters are (currently) completely
     ignored by the main <span class="pas">lift</span> program.

</p><h4>Metadata</h4>
  <p>As Prino didn’t want to make the format of the data even more complex than it already is, he
     decided to allow for comments and meta-data to be embedded into the input file. Both comments
     and meta-data start with a “{” and can be up to 255 characters long.

        provides information about the time zones for the countries passed in a trip. The difference
        between the two variants is that time zone information following a “<strong>{Z-</strong>”
        completely replaces the current set of countries/time zone pairs, whereas “<strong>{Z+</strong>”
        will add additional countries/time zone data pairs or replace existing ones. The option can be
        used in multi-zonal countries, or in trips that span the change from winter- into summer-time,
        or the reverse.

        <p>Up to 31 country/time zone data pairs immediately follow the “<strong>{Zx</strong>” and
           consist of eight characters,

                offset must be in the format “+nnX” or “-nnX”, where the “X” can be “&nbsp;”, and, theoretically, as this
                functionality has not yet been implemented, “a”, “b”, or “c”, indicating an additional offset of 15,
                30, or 45 minutes.<br><br>
                Assuming that the partial hour functionality will at some stage be implemented, the time zone information
                for a theoretical trip through the Netherlands, Nepal, and Newfoundland would be encoded as<br><br>

            </li><li>the Work Station Agent (an IBM tool supplied with ISPF, the z/OS “IDE”),
          </li></ol>

        <p>of transferring data between the ASCII/UTF-8 realm and z/OS. All three allow lossless transfers
           from and to z/OS, but all use (in many cases) different translate tables for ASCII control
           characters (<span class="tt">0x00..0x1F</span>) and characters between <span class="tt">0x80..0xFF</span>
           (many of which are used to encode UTF-8 characters). Using the ASCII metadata allows programs written in
           PL/I (and COBOL) to detect UTF-8 characters no matter which transfer procedure is used. Feel free to

<h3>The results of Prino’s current programs</h3>
  <p>The current programs produce rather a lot more output than the five tables per trip! In fact,
     the main program now produces eight files and an optional additional post-processor program that
     translates the output into .RTF format creates two additional files with two tables sorted in
     various other orders. The programs and files, assuming their default names, they produce are:

</p><h3>The main program, <span class="pas">lift</span></h3>

<p id="disclaimer"><em><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Much of the code in <span class="pas">lift</span> was written
   before Prino implemented support for time zones, and even now he does <strong>not</strong> record
   the odometer reading at the “correct” midnight for those rides that span multiple days!</em>

</p><p><em>As a consequence, the following tables might contain erroneous or misleading data:</em>

  </p><ul>
    <li class="li double"><em>the “totals per day” table in the “per trip” section of “<a href="#flift">lift.h-h</a>”.
        These tables theoretically contain days that go from midnight, 0:00, to midnight, 24:00, but
        have a length exceeding 24 hours. However, in these particular tables, the <em>zone</em> column
        will correct any discrepancy in the summation of the other columns.</em>

    </li><li><em>All tables that reuse per-day data in any way. All of them are marked below with a
        “See disclaimer” note.</em>

<h4 id="flift">“lift.h-h” - Detailed summaries per trip, type, country, nationality, and year</h4>
  <p>This file contains detailed summaries per trip, type (of driver/vehicle), country, nationality
     (of driver), and year. It contains a section for each of these entities, split by
     “<b>Totals per type/country/nationality/year</b>” separator pages.

</p><h4 id="flift-sect-per-trip">The “per trip” section</h4>
  <p>The “per trip” section contains four pages per trip:

  </p><h5>Page 1</h5>
    <ol>
      <li id="flift-tot-per-day">a table with totals per day (See <a href="#disclaimer">disclaimer</a>)
      </li><li>a table of totals for all distances

      </li><li>a table of totals for all nationalities
      </li><li>a table of totals for all speeds
      </li><li>a max/min/average summary for all rides and days (See <a href="#disclaimer">disclaimer</a>)
     </li></ol>

  <h5>Page 2</h5>

      </li>
    </ol>

  <h5>Page 4</h5>

          </li><li>a table that just summarises the distance per country
        </li></ul>
    </li></ol>

<h4 id="flift-sect-per-type">The “per type” section</h4>
  <p>The “per type” section (currently) contains two pages per type (of driver/vehicle), containing
     the following seven tables:

  </p><h5>Page 1</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>a table of totals for all distances
      </li><li>a table of totals for all countries
      </li><li>a table of totals for all nationalities
      </li><li>a table of totals for all speeds
    </li></ol>

  <h5>Page 2</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>a table with the distribution of hourly departure times per weekday
      </li><li>a table of progressively longer rides for this type
      </li><li>a table of progressively faster rides for this type
      </li><li>a table of progressively longer non-stop rides
      </li><li>a table of DTV (+ L=) per type (“Thumb”, “Ask”, or “Other”) of pickup
      </li><li>a max/min/average summary for the type
    </li></ol>

  <p>Note that the “per type” section individual per-type pages do not contain a <b>totals-per-type</b>
     table, as it would contain just a single line with the totals for that particular type. Instead
     the type is merged into the heading of the totals-for-all-distances table.

</p><h4 id="flift-sect-per-cnty">The “per country” section</h4>
  <p>The “per country” section (currently) contains one page per country travelled in, containing
     the following five tables:

  </p><h5>Page 1</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>a table of totals for all waits
      </li><li>a table of the statistical waiting time distribution
      </li><li>a table with the distribution of departure times
    </li></ol>

  <h5>Page 2</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>a table of DTV (+ L=) per type (“Thumb”, “Ask”, or “Other”) of pickup
      </li><li>a table of waits per type of pickup, split in short and long waits
      </li><li>a table of progressively longer distances per calendar day for this country
      </li><li>a table with the longest/fastest rides starting in this country and crossing successively more borders
      </li><li>a max/min/average summary for the country, containing two
 rows, one for the non-border-crossing rides, and one for the 
border-crossing rides
    </li></ol>

  <p>Note that this section does not include a <b>totals-per-country</b> table. Like in the “per type”
     section, the country is merged into the heading of the first table on the page.

</p><h4 id="flift-sect-per-nat">The “per nationality” section</h4>
  <p>The “per nationality” section (currently) contains one page per nationality of driver, containing
     the following seven tables:

  </p><h5>Page 1</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>a table of totals for all distances
      </li><li>a table of totals for all types
      </li><li>a table of totals for all countries
      </li><li>a table of totals for all speeds
      </li><li>a table of progressively longer rides for this nationality
      </li><li>a table of progressively faster rides for this nationality
      </li><li>a table of progressively longer non-stop rides
      </li><li>a max/min/average summary for the nationality
    </li></ol>

  <p>Note that the “per nationality” section individual per-nationality pages do not contain a <b>totals-per-nationality</b>
     table. It follows the format of the two previously described sections, and merges the nationality
     into the heading of the first table on the page.

</p><h4 id="flift-sect-per-year">The “per year” section</h4>
  <p>The “per year” section (currently) contains six pages per year, containing
     the following tables:

  </p><h5>Page 1</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>a table of totals for all distances
      </li><li>a table of totals for all types
      </li><li>a table of totals for all countries
      </li><li>a table of totals for all nationalities
      </li><li>a table of totals for all speeds
      </li><li>a max/min/average summary for all rides and days (See <a href="#disclaimer">disclaimer</a>)
    </li></ol>

  <h5>Page 2</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>a table of totals for all waits
      </li><li>a table of the statistical waiting time distribution
      </li><li>a table of all in-ride waits per category (*)
      </li><li>a table of waits per country, split into short and long waits
    </li></ol>

  <h5>Page 3</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>three tables of pick-ups
        <ul class="disc">
          <li>per nationality per country
          </li><li>per country per type
          </li><li>per nationality per type

      </li>
    </ol>

  <h5>Page 4</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>a max/min/average summary for all types
      </li><li>a max/min/average summary for all nationalities
      </li><li>a max/min/average summary for all countries
      </li><li>a table that summarises the distance per country, split into non-border-crossing and border-crossing rides
    </li></ol>

  <h5>Page 5</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>a table with the longest consecutive distance inside each country visited in the year
      </li><li>a table with all per-country segments for the whole year
    </li></ol>

  <h5>Page 6</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>a table of totals for all distances per day (See <a href="#disclaimer">disclaimer</a>)
      </li><li>a table of totals for all speeds per day (See <a href="#disclaimer">disclaimer</a>)
      </li><li>a table with totals per weekday (See <a href="#disclaimer">disclaimer</a>)

      </li><li>a table with progressively longer 24-hour periods
      </li><li>a table with the total period in days hitched during the year
    </li></ol>

  <p>Like in all previous sections, the year is merged into the heading of the first table on page 1 of each “per-year” page.

</p><h4>Additional notes regarding the “lift.h-h” file</h4>
  <ul class="disc">
    <li>Tables marked with “(*)” above may not always be present.
    </li><li>On some occasions logical pages may overflow onto a second physical page. <span class="pas">lift</span>
        and <span class="pas">h-h2rtf</span> are not yet capable of detecting this problem.
  </li></ul>

<h4 id="fdays">“days.h-h” - Per day summary</h4>
  <p>This file contains a single table with a line for every calendar day of every trip, detailing
    </p><ul class="disc">
      <li>the number of the trip
      </li><li>the day in the trip
      </li><li>the distance hitched during the day (See <a href="#disclaimer">disclaimer</a>)
      </li><li>the (actual) driving time during the day (See <a href="#disclaimer">disclaimer</a>)
      </li><li>the average velocity for the day
      </li><li>the date
    </li></ul>

  <p>A follow-up program, <span class="pas">dayform</span>, will process this file, putting the
     original single-column data into four columns of 70 rows. It also sorts the file into three
     additional orders, Distance, Time and Velocity. If the data is required to be in .RTF format,
     this program is required.

</p><h4 id="ftrip">“trip.h-h” - Formatted input data</h4>
  <p>This file contains the input data in a neat table, omitting the odometer, place of
     departure, and arrival columns. <span class="pas">lift</span> will paginate trips that do
     not fit on a single sheet of A4 paper.

</p><h4 id="fweek">“week.h-h” - Weekday per year summary</h4>
  <p>This file always contains the following two tables:

    </p><ol>
      <li>a table with the number of times and distance/time/velocity hitched on every weekday (Mon
          to Sun) for every year, and
      </li><li>a table of pickups and distance/time/velocity per weekday per day of the month (+ totals).
    </li></ol>

  <p>However, if the input file contains more than 1,000 rides, the second table is split out into
      an additional 12 tables, one per month, replacing the pickups by the number of days hitched.

</p><h4 id="fmnth">“mnth.h-h” - Month per year summaries</h4>
  <p>This file contains five tables with monthly data:

    </p><ol>
      <li class="li">a table containing days hitched and distance per month per year, (See <a href="#disclaimer">disclaimer</a>)
      </li><li class="li">a table cumulating the results of the previous table, giving a running total per year, (See <a href="#disclaimer">disclaimer</a>)
      </li><li class="li" i="">a table detailing the total distance per calendar day per month, (See <a href="#disclaimer">disclaimer</a>)
      </li><li class="li" i="">a table detailing the first use (or not) of all 366 calendar days, and
      </li><li class="li">a table simply containing a list of days hitched, distances, time and velocities for every month. (See <a href="#disclaimer">disclaimer</a>)
      </li><li class="li">five tables of cumulative data per month tables, sorted, except for the first, descending on
      <ol>
        <li class="al">the day of the month, 1..29/30/31
        </li><li class="al">total days hitched for the day of the month
        </li><li class="al">total distance  for the day of the month
        </li><li class="al">total time for the day of the month
        </li><li class="al">average velocity for the day of the month
      </li></ol>
    </li></ol>

  <p>Like the first table in “week.h-h”, the first four tables in this file do not contain time or velocity data.

  </p><p>A follow-up program, <span class="pas">mnthform</span>, will process this file, merging the first
     four originally split-in-half tables, and putting the original single column data of the fifth into
     four columns of (up to) 70 rows and sorts this table into four additional orders, Days, Distance,
     Time and Velocity. It also produces five additional pages with per calendar month tables sorted in
     days, distance, time, verlocity, and average distance per day per month. If the data is required
     to be in .RTF format, this program is required.

</p><h4 id="fntop">“ntop.h-h” - Top-N tables</h4>
  <p>This file contains sets of three Top-N tables:
  </p><ol>
    <li class="li">three top-50 tables for all rides (for distance, time, and velocity)
    </li><li class="li">three top-10 tables for each trip, type, country, nationality, and year (ditto)
  </li></ol>

  <p>In those cases where there are less than 10 rides in a trip, for a type, in a country,
     for a nationality, or in a year, the Top-10 may actually reduce to, in some cases, a Top-1,
     which is then repeated three times for distance, time, and velocity…

</p><h4 id="fxtra">“xtra.h-h” - stuff</h4>
  <p>This file contains six tables that should really be in “summ.h-h”, but due to the
     fact that they are in landscape format, with lines much longer than the self-imposed
     121-character line length limit of that file, they are in this file.

  </p><p>The first two tables in this file record “milestones”:
  </p><ol>
    <li class="li">a table containing the details of the ride where Prino reached a “milestone” in number of rides
    </li><li class="li">a table containing the details of the ride where Prino reached a “milestone” in the hitched distance
  </li></ol>

  <p>The next three tables contain all sets of “n” rides where
  </p><ol>
    <li>each ride in the set of “n” is longer than the previous one
    </li><li>each ride in the set of “n” is faster than the previous one
    </li><li>each ride in the set of “n” is longer <em>and</em> faster than the previous one
  </li></ol>

  <p>The final table contains a list of all progressively longer non-stop rides

</p><h3>An optional program, <span class="pas">newlift</span></h3>
  <p>The set of programs contains an optional program, <span class="pas">newlift</span>, which can be used to
     remove all data that does not relate to the current trip from
    </p><ul>
      <li>“lift.h-h”, leaving only
        <ul class="circle">
          <li>four pages for the current trip,
          </li><li>a “Totals per type” separator page, followed by two pages for every type that appeared in the current trip,
          </li><li>a “Totals per country” separator page, followed by one page for every country that appeared in the current trip,
          </li><li>a “Totals per nationality” separator page, followed by one page for every nationality that appeared in the current trip, and
          </li><li class="li double">a “Totals per year” separator page, followed by six pages per year for the year(s) of the current trip.
        </li></ul>
      </li><li>“ntop.h-h”, leaving only
        <ul class="circle">
          <li>the three Top-50 tables (if any of them contains any reference to the current trip),
          </li><li>a “Top-10 per trip” separator page, followed by the Top-10 table for the current trip
          </li><li>a “Top-10 per type” separator page, followed by one page for every type that appeared in the current trip,

          </li><li class="li double">a “Top-10 per year” separator page, followed by one page for every year that contained rides of the current trip.
        </li></ul>
        <strong>Note:</strong> The “Top-10 per …” pages are always present in the output file, but the sections themselves may be
        empty if the current trip does not contain any rides that end up in any of the Top-10 tables.<br><br>
      </li><li>“trip.h-h”, leaving only
        <ul class="circle">
          <li>the page(s) containing the formatted output of the current trip.
        </li></ul>
    </li></ul>

  <p>which is kinder to trees if you insist on also keeping the results on paper.

</p><h3>Two more, somewhat less optional, programs, <span class="pas">dayform</span> and <span class="pas">mnthform</span></h3>
  <p><span class="pas">dayform</span> is a post-processor for <span class="pas">lift</span>. It takes in
     “days.h-h”, and spits it out in a multi-column (4x70) format. It also sorts the input file
     into three additional (distance, time, and velocity) orders and outputs those in the same
     multi-column format.

  </p><p><span class="pas">mnthform</span> is another post-processor for <span class="pas">lift</span>. It takes in
     “mnth.h-h”, merges the first four per-six-months tables, and converts the single column per-month data into
     a multi-columnar (4x10n, n=1..7) format, creating a set of 15 tables—the cumulative data per month tables are
     not changed

     </p><ol>

  <p>Note that <span class="pas">newlift</span> actually modifies the “lift.h-h”, “ntop.h-h”, and “trip.h-h” files,
     whereas <span class="pas">dayform</span> and <span class="pas">mnthform</span> will spit out the result of
     processing “days.h-h” and “mnth.h-h” into new files, “days.h-c” and “mnth.h-c”.
