# Building predictive models and drawing hitchhiking maps

`final_maps`/ ... high resolution maps

`maps`/ ... more maps

`intermediate/ ... maps in raw format`

`models/` ... pickled models to draw the maps

`writeup_heatchmap.ipynb` ... long ML heavy writeup

`summary_maps.ipynb` ... short writeup for the community

`draw_map.py/draw_maps.ipynb` ... creating the fiinal maps that are shown in `summary_maps.ipynb`

## Framework to build your own models
