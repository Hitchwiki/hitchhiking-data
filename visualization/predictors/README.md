# Building predictive models and drawing hitchhiking maps

`final_maps`/ ... high resolution maps

`maps`/ ... more maps

`intermediate/` ... maps in raw format

`models/` ... pickled models to draw the maps

`draw_map.py & draw_maps.ipynb` ... creating the final maps that are shown in `summary_maps.ipynb`

`experiments_*.ipynb` ... our own experiments with the models from `models.py`.

`models.py` ... models we applied so far include
  - Gaussian process
  - weighted Gaussians
  - average of all waiting times (baseline)
  - average of same-size rectangles

<ins>`summary_maps.ipynb` ... short writeup for the community</ins>

<ins>`writeup_heatchmap.ipynb` ... long ML heavy writeup</ins>

## Framework to build your own models
We encourage you to contribute to this repository by filing PRs once you start building new models and maps.

How you build models, evaluate them, and draw new maps from them is showcased in `writeup_heatchmap.ipynb`.

One way to build your model is to inherit from `MapBasedModel` in `models.py` - this class is responsible for drawing maps as well.
