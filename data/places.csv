Good spot. Bus from potsdam take you only a short walk away. Used a sign to get to Hannover, as we did not speak any German. Seemed to be plenty of traffic. Truck driver the one to take us in the end. Waited around 1 hour.

Was here on a Wednesday around 11am. Even though traffic was really low I got a lift further than Bielefeld after approx. 1h. I guess chances are much higher earlier in the morning or later in the afternoon when traffic ramps up.

―Maxim1110 (Hitchwiki), February 2015

Great place!! Arrived Tuesday midday and got picked up in 10 mins, just standing at the exit with my thum up by a super speedy car to Munich! (if you are in a hurry I think there's so much traffic you could even avoid trucks and go for cars)

―Masanfe (Hitchwiki), June 2015

Might be a bit tricky to reach from Berlin, Hauptbanhof. To get there take S7 in the direction of Potsdam and either take E23/33 from ""Wannsee"" or take the bus (ask the information office which number you have to take) to Michendorf Banhof and exit two stations after that station, then walk for about two kilometers and you are there.

It's a great spot with many opportunities, I would definitely recommend this spot to everyone! 

―Yooks (Hitchwiki), August 2015

Due to construction side (10.2017) there are very few cars on this side, definitive not recommended until the construction is over

―Anonymous, October 2017

I made the same experience. Most of the cars are heading towards Hannover. Very few going southwards to Leipzig/Hermsdorfer Kreuz. Had to change my route to Frankfurt tremendously. Was shitty weather though and noone was willing to stop or a give me a lift.

―Kai (Hitchwiki), October 2011

An epic location towards the selfidentified-West: Magdeburg, Osna, Amsterdam, anywhere

―Liftegreven (Hitchwiki), November 2011

Going towards Stuttgart/Frankfurt is also possible but a longer wait is needed (~1h).  Do not make the mistake to stand at the parking exit, go to the petrol pumps instead.

Not the best but nevertheless a good spot to go towards west direction (A2). Me and my friend (two guys) waited here for 1 hour. There is a parking here, you can ask drivers too. The only problem is lack of traffic sometimes.

Michendorf
Very good spot to go in direction of Hannover. Just ask the drivers on the station.

―Anonymous

Most of the cars are going to Hannover or Hamburg. Leipzig/Stuttgart direction is difficult but doable. French cars preferable.

―Anonymous

michendorf, michendorf, if the world would be as easy to understand as 'michendorf rastanlage' everyone would love to live here! hannover, magdeburg, dortmund, leipzig, munich are to reach from this spot. you should definitely (!) wait for a driver that can take you all the way to your destination and NOT only until the next rest area (which might not be as good as 'michendorf'). if you need to reach the other side of the rastanlage (if you are only transiting berlin) you need to walk in the direction of michedorf village center (aks inside the station; they have local maps), walk underneath the 'berliner autobahnring' (200 meters east of the area) and follow the concrete way through the forest on the other side. this maneuver can take up to 30 minutes even though it looks shorter on this map. there is an ALDI as well as REWE market (open until 10 P.M.) in the center of the village of 'michendorf' (detour changing the sides of rest areas + shopping = 10 minutes).
again: my 'michendorf recommendation' is to wait until someone can take you to your day's final destination, don't just take the first car as this spot is excellent! on my personal ranking ""1"" (very-very poor) to ""10"" (excellent) i will rate this spot a ""9 to 10"".

An excellent spot for going South and West. Get her by taking the regional train into direction Dessau, and get off at Michendorf for a walk of half an hour.

Great spot for those who try to switch autobahn to go south. Just stand there with a sign on which you wrote the name of the city you are trying to get to. At first we tried to ask around but standing with the sign is better idea.

Allertal is the last station before crossing A2. so if you want to go directing Berlin or Magdeburg/Leipzig you should get out here. most people are travelling to the south so it's not thaaat easy. but if you ask for Braunschweig you can get off at the next petrol station on the A2 in front of Braunschweig (Zweidorfer Holz).

my fav in dd (i live around the corner)! i hitchhiked very often to berlin from here. i waited from 1 minute (sunny weather) til 30 minute (heavy snowing). i often stand before the shell petrol station, but asking the drivers direcly at the petrol station is also a good idea. it's also a good starting point for going to leipzig, chemnitz and further west and south (bavaria, austria, italy, france, spain). you should ask for the raststätte dresdner tor near wilsdruff. there you can change the car easily.

―JonParnell (Hitchwiki), March 2014

Even though the traffic is not so dense, this is a very good spot to get on the highway. The cars are driving slow enough and the location is good. You should stand at the point where the lane splits on to the lane that goes to the highway.

―Yooks (Hitchwiki), February 2015

I waited 10 min to get a ride
to the next Gas Station 20km down the A8. from there it was easy
Traffic here comes car by car, so its easy for them to stop!
Take the Subway to Airport and walk there.

If you want to hitchhike from Nuremberg to Munich or elsewhere south and you dont know nobody with a car -  this is my hotspot. Just take the S-Bahn Nr. 3 to Feucht and then you can walk to this servicestation - directly on the motorway (germ. Autobahn)Just follow the Schwarzenbrucker Strae and turn left (uphill) after the first bridge but befor the next railroad bridge. 

For me there is just one disatvantage if you are in a hurry - from the S-Bahn station Feucht to the servicestation youll need around 45 min.

Maybe not the safest, but the roundabout has enough room on the side to let cars and even trucks pull over to let you get in. If you stand before the exit you need to take the ones going in your direction (Autobahn) will be slow. Works even in the dark, though that certainly is not advisable!

The two of us tried to hitch a ride in this spot, with no success. There are a lot of cars and their speed is not very high, but the cars on the outer lane (the one closer to you) are turning to the local neighborhoods on the roundabout and the ones you want to catch going to Berlin are on the inner one.

'hamburg - horner kreisel'; an excellent spot to reach 'berlin', 'lbeck', 'rostock' or to find someone driving in the direction of denmark ('copenhagen' or 'roskilde'). there is a busstop where you can stand, the round-about is a safe (for drivers) and legal (for you) spot to stand at. it should not take more than 20 minutes to find a driver. there is a marker place right on the on-ramp of the autobahn, people tend not to stop at this exact spot anymore as they are already speeding up. don't stand on the autobahn itself after the blue 'autobahn' (bridge/road) sign or a blue square sign showing only a car, it is illegal. find out how to get to 'horner kreisel' via the hamburg public transportation sytem website: www.hvv.de .

Easiest way to get to Maastricht is to find a driver going to Belgium or Eindhoven over the A76 in the Netherlands, then get out at A76 exit Geleen and hitch with sign Maastricht.

To get to Maastricht you can also find here any driver going to Heerlen-Eindhoven-Antwerpen, after crossing the border let the driver take the exit N281. Parallel road, the N281 has an exit Maastricht (with a petrol station at the beginning of the A79!). Then driver goes on on N281 towards his destination.

This is a great spot to get out of Cologne, and it’s directly at the Autobahn already!

The station is directly at the path so that’s no problem. Climbing the fence is a bit tricky because it’s pointy, but if you walk past the station there is a spot where a tree is bent over the fence (maybe not anymore).

I waited only a few minutes, there was much traffic. Only problem: There is a fence around the station, so maybe you have to climb. But thats no big deal.
To come here take the train RB 25 from the cologne main station in the direction Marienheide or Overath for 3,20 . Leave at Stmpen and turn right and go up to the Kiefernweg and turn right. Follow the street that is later called Dammelsfurther Weg up to the Pestalozziweg for maybe 500 meters and turn right. Now you pass the Autobahn and turn right again in the Plantage. Follow this way a few hundred meters through the forest and you will see a service station on the right side. Maybe you have to climb a fence. Now you are on the a station without oil station but much traffic. Easy to get a ride here. Totally it takes approximately 40 minutes from the cologne main station. In my experience this is the best possibility to leave cologne.

i wanted to go from west to east on a monday afternoon in summer. even though the rasthof and fuel station is accessible from both directions of the A4 most of the cars stopping there went from east to west - it's on the ""wrong"" side. some car-owners, who seemed to go east, spoke only polish and russian. this place is out in the sticks and it depressed me basically because i waited there for 1:30 hours. depressing was the decay of the former hotel there, now a fitness centre, the lonely old prostitute waiting for a job, the weathered former sex-shop, the fucked up local guys sitting there all day long on their plastic chairs. never again!

Best ride I ever had,I was standing under the sign( mention in the description)saying ""Prague"" it is safe but a bit difficult to reach check weel the map. and if you are going there by bus tell the driver which  place you are going and make him understand you are hitchhiking, for me it helped. After 10 min. late in the afternoon, whether was not very good a car stopped and strait to Prague. The girl that was driving was caring two people that were carpooling and one was going to Prague and I when at the same hostel(I didm't have one) and the driver brought us AT the hostel in the center of Prague seriously she waled in the hostel with us!!

to get to praha (prague, prag) on autobahn 'A 17' this is a good spot. you can stand underneath (or in front of-) the tall blue 'PIRNA - PRAHA' sign on 'B 170'. there is a curbside where the road bends onto the autobahn's on ramp, it is safe (legal) to stand there also safe for drivers to stop on the mentioned (cobbled) sliproad. you will know what i mean if you see it. to get there you can take the ??? bus from the city center which stops only a few hundred meters away or walk for around 30 minutes from the dresden DB main station via 'fritz-lffler strae', 'bergstrae', 'innsbrucker strae' and  'possendorfer strae' (do not follow 'innsbrucker strae' all its way but shortcut through 'kaitz' village). there is a noise protection wall between 'possendorfer strae' and 'B 170' but don't worry, there are doors to open in the wall. don't miss the view on elbsandsteingebirge from the B 170 bridge over the autobahn. on my personal ranking ""1"" (very-very poor) to ""10"" (excellent) i will rate this spot a ""7 to 8"".

rasthof/relais 'hermsdorfer kreuz' is maybe one of the best german places to start or intermediate your journey. there is plenty of traffic 24 hours/7 days a week. a restaurant as well as a snack bar make this place very convenient. from here nonstop hitchhikes even to denmark or poland should be possible. a footunnel (300 meters north of the petrol station) connects the eastern part of the rastanlage with the western portion. waiting times for a trip to berlin are around 15 minutes.

'rastanlage auerswalder blick' is a good option to travel west- or estward on A4, direction 'hermsdorfer kreuz' (west, you can change from that relais/rastanlage to all directions) or east, towards dresden and the german-polish border. rastanlage auerswalder blick you can reach by bus from the city center of chemnitz and a short walk of 20 minutes. a tunnel 500 meters west of the relais (or a bridge another 500 meters further) lets you change the sides of the autobahn.

For Chemnitz and the center of Leipzig, this is a very good spot. But for Kassel/ Göttingen we waited 1,5 hours. It was the thrid car to head this destination in this period of time. The journey from Leipzig took us very long as well. Pack some food and a good load of time for this one. 

―Anonymous, August 2017

Average rest area with just a WC. From my point of view a very good spot to get from Leipzig to any westbound destination. For near and easy things like Kassel or Gttingen or more advantageous aims like Southern Netherlands or Northern France this could be a gould start. The A 38 is from my experience a good connection to the west: very few congestions but still enough traffic to get away.

How to get there:
Take a train from Leipzig Central Station to Liebertwolkwitz Station (takes 15mins) and then just walk there (takes 20-30 mins) via ""Gropsnaer Strae"". Important note: This section of the Autobahn is fenced like many others. To finally acces the Rastplatz you either need to climb the fence (quite manageable) or bring tools.

I waited there for almost two hours to with a sing to Osnabrück. After that time, a couple take me five minutes away, to IKEA, they told me that there was a better spot. They were right. In IKEA busstop I waited 40min

―Anonymous, September 2014

Having MUCH experience with this spot, I would say this is absolutely average. Once, I even had to give up when I wanted to travel to Berlin. Most often, I just got a ride for a couple of kilometers until the next fuel station, which is again just average. Usually have to wait here for 30min-1hour with my wife. Without her up to infinity haha. Close to the fuel station are some traffic lights. My personal opinion: It's better to stay behind the traffic lights!

―Sattleryan (Hitchwiki), April 2015

Took that spot 4 or 5 times now, alone as a guy, during day time. 
Max waiting time was about an hour, min. about 5 min, avg. about 20-30min. 
Its a pretty good spot to get North and south on the A1, it is important though to ask people and be happy with being taken only to the next Gas station ON THE A1. 
It is ok but not perfect, dont know a better spot though. 

―Wasserpflanze (Hitchwiki), August 2015

Monday, ca. 15:00 o'clock. Many locals drive by to fill up fuel. Only a few cars leaving the city.
It took me 30 minutes to find a lift to the next gas station in direction to Hamburg on A1.

Be sure to approach the gasstation on the side of the traffic leaving the city, because it's nearly impossible to cross the road during rushour.

―Anonymous, November 2017

If you want to go to Hannover/A7 south, ask people from Verden (license plate VER) if they can take you to the service area ""Goldbach"" on the A27 at exit Langwedel. It's not far, but definitely a better place to find a lift to the south.

―Anonymous, September 2014

Very nice spot general direction south. It's a bit more difficult for straight direction west if you want to enter the Netherlands from the far north to Groningen.
Reasons: IKEA is just behind the spot and hence there are many people from all over the place to buy some furniture. This can also cause problems, when they are totally loaded.
How to get there:
Take either tram line no. 4 or 5 to station 'Huckelriede' then switch over into bus line no. 53 until the end (IKEA) or station 'Carl-Zeiss-Str.'
(one earlier). Be aware that you leave the city boarders, when using Bus 53. You'll need an area-extension if you don't want to dodge the fare.
Good ride and quick hitch,

Waited 1 houer for a Lift to Hannover (A7).

But 5(!) offers in direction Bremen (A1).

General many peoples you could ask for a lift.

―Anonymous

all the information given in the other markers are correct. 'rastanlage hamburg stillhorn' is easy to reach via s-bahn (the suburban train, get off at 'wilhelmsburg' station), then take the metrobus to 'kirchdorf sued', one of hamburg's communal highrise districts. negative about this spot: there is a lot of commuter traffic. most people that fuel their cars would do it in hamburg but not on the autobahn as it is more expensive there. maybe you can also ask at the restaurant which is 100 meters south of the petrol station. you can reach 'bremen' (on A 1), 'hannover' but also 'goettingen' or 'kassel' (on A 7) from here.

also to go to south (A7) very good, you can reach this point easyly!

-probably good for: direction Bremen (A1)

Right after the traffic lights there's parking space where car can stop. Sign is necessary. Way to Stettin(Szczecin) and Hamburg. Easy to reach from tram M4 stop ""Berliner Alee/Indira-Gandhi-Strasse"" Not a bad place but perhaps the further spots could be better.

On the way I have seen some other gas stations before the roads going to Kiel and Rostock split. So maybe you can accept a ride to Hamburg or Kiel at this gas station here, and you just ask for the driver to drop you off at one of the next gas stations where you still might find people going to Rostock, if that's what you want.

So, not too much, but enough cars going ahead to Berlin, the rest is just local traffic or sourrounds the capital via A10. If you are not successful, just ask the people refueling their cars at the gas station.

take a close look where the marker is exactly positioned. there is other markers at the gasstation as well as closer to the on-ramp of the autobahn but i found to stand at the traffic light the best opportunity. if you are standing in front of the gasstation you have the problem that cars tend to speed up to 100 km/h even before they have reached the autobahn - at this speed people normally do not stop anymore for a hitchhiker. i have seen people standing there for hours - while i was waiting for five (5) minutes at the same day/time (to catch a berlin - hamburg driver). at the traffic light drivers have the time to decide to take you (- or not). the spot is excellent to reach the northern berlin surroundings, 'schwerin' or 'hamburg'. on my personal rating from ""1"" (very-very poor) to ""10"" (excellent) i rate this spot a ""9 to 10"".

So, we were waiting here for an hour and a half without any result. We stood at the begging of the road to gates, i guess drivers at these moment only thought about what gate they have to choose, therefore they didn't stop. Maybe it's better to go futher right to the gates or conversely go back deeper to the island. Anyway good luck!

Holmmoor is a good place to get a lift, but there are far less cars stopping than in Aalbek a few kilometres to the north. hamburg or bremen should be no problem, but hannover or berlin is quite tricky. nevertheless, if you got time and a little piece of patience, you wont wait longer than 1 hour.

After having been here for the 3rd time trying to get a lift to the A2 towards Magdeburg I can confirm it is much harder than going north. While lots of people would have taken me towards Hannover, Hamburg or Bremen, there were few going towards Braunschweig in the first place. 
You can accept lifts to Braunschweig or Wolfsburg, there is a gas station at the A39 with almost no traffic, but better chances to get a lift further east. 

―N0id (Hitchwiki), September 2013

Although it seems perfect for the direction north to Hamburg, it's not recommendable to get to A2 in the direction of Berlin. If you're coming from A5 rather choose A4 and A9 to get to Berlin.

I have to disagree. I was also going towards Leipzig, most cars do indeed continue to Berlin, you just have to spot the Czech, Slovak, Hungarian, or any car/truck that surely will go south, like Romanians and Bulgarians. I found a ride all the way to Prague.

one of berlins good places to leave the city. from the center of berlin, you reach the relais (rastanlage) with the s-bahn indicating 'potsdam' or 'wannsee', get off at nikolassee station. the walk takes less than two minutes. there is a traffic light as well as a petrol station and restaurant. many drivers go south on A 115 which can alternatively take you to 'rastanlage michendorf' (10 minutes) on 'berliner ring' where the situation for hitchhikers is even better. from michendorf it should not take longer than 10 minutes to find a driver to hannover, dessau (A8), leipzig (A8) or even munich (A8).

It's a really perfect place to go to cities like Dortmund (other hitchhiker I met there had to wait for only 30min that day) also on a Sunday there were many many dutch and polish people passing going back to the Netherlands, if they are not full, they will take you!

Well i choose this new spot as i already went to the parking of mac donald and speak to everyone with no luck , so basicky anyone who is going to the petrol station or mac donald can see me , just buy the grass standing with a sign , 1h30 min of wait to go to poznan , so i guess not bad !

bad place to start.. lot of cars going by but either they were unfriendly or didn't go to nuremberg. sign highly recommended, because people can still go everywhere from there. hard to focus on drivers with so much traffic zooming by, and I think quite some people didn't stop because it's not a good place to stop, although there is some space. I'll try a different spot next time. PS: lots of ants here!

―Micha (Hitchwiki), April 2014

Super good place, you will maybe need a little to find a car ( max. 1-2h ), but will get out of the city for sure. My fastest lift was straight to berlin in 5min, and the longest I had to wait 1:30h-2h something like that. My best experience is to only show your thumb, people will stop and you can ask them where they go. Signs like ""Berlin"" or ""Direction Berlin"" will only confuse them, since they think they can only take you if they go directly to Berlin.

―Yorick (Hitchwiki), May 2014

August 2014. Really good place. If you're going far north, it's better to have a sign that says A9 than your final destination. I waited for 30 min with a sign for Berlin, but got a ride after 15 min after switching to A9. The warning about the ants is legit. :D

you have to catch a driver who can pick you to this spot. If a driver doesnt go your direction, but opposite is also good, you need just take a walk 80m (or he can easily turn back also). Dont try to get there from trian station by foot (its 2km, and no a sidewalk, nor bicycle path)

better if you have someone, who can bring you there by car. otherwise you need to take the train to Nrnberg-Fischbach(every 20min. from N.Mainstation) and take a walk there (20min. side of the road). stand (with sign) right afer bridge. --> in the curve is plenty of room to park! 4/5 when you need to walk there, otherwise 5/5

You can get here from Freiburg by taking Bus No. 36 towards Hochdorf, exit Bus station Hgestrae. Makes sense if you're trying to make a long distance. Otherwise you might just stay at Kronenbrcke, all together it will take the same amount of time.

Coming from the north it works the same, if you want to get to freiburg let them drop you out here, try to find someone who is going directly to freiburg or take bus no. 36.

Wait a little bit ahead of the traffic lights. Behind it there is a little street to pick you up.

You can go there by bus (Line 5). Direction: Gereuth, Bus Station: Mohnstrae.

Gas station at the road that leads southwards to the A5 motorway. Best place to get from Heidelberg to Karlsruhe, Basel or Stuttgart. Lots of cars filling gas before entering the motorway, it's also possible to stand at the street with a sign as cars have good possibilities to stop.

Works well for both directions on the motorway but yes, maybe better for East, as mentioned in the descripiton. Although we managed to get a lift to Stuttgart in 5 mins on Saturday evening after sunset. I suggest to wait not exactly at the gas station exit but 20 m after that, under a big street lamp (so you are visible at night as well) because by doing so more cars will be within your reach. (On the map: Shell -> Robert-Bosch-Strasse, ~20 m to the North there's a loop, then a turn towards to big roundabout. Go straight and the first turn, which is the nearest to the highway, is the one I'm talking about)

―Gustavobretz (Hitchwiki), June 2016

Insa and Jan (and seemingly many cars) found this gas station confusing because the exit signage is a bit strange. Nevertheless, as Adrian described, it seems to be best to hitch with a sign from this curve.
One problem though is that we wanted to go south towards Freiburg and Switzerland, but most cars which stopped went either into Karlsruhe or north. In the end we took a car going north and switched at the Bruchsal service station, which is the first both-sided one north of Karlsruhe with a car bridge nearby making it possible to switch sides.

―Jan (Hitchwiki), June 2013

Waited for 5 hours with my friend. Most cars went to opposite direction (we tried to go to Karlsruhe). But when we started asking people, our first try was successful (actually, we got to the south, but it was eventually useful).

―Anonymous, August 2016

This exact spot, in the curve when two exits meet, is only for North! South exit is at the other end of the station. Walk around and read the boards carefully first! Huge resting area, filling station plus restaurant, but few cars stopped for us. Nearly impossible to get to France with one ride from here, none of the French drivers gave us a lift.

Towards Karlsruhe. One of the spots with the biggest chance towards West in Stuttgart, I think. Though, it is not easy to get here by public transport from the city centre. 2 persons (me and my girlfriend), Sunday morning, Karlsruhe, 15 mins.

Not in direction West! For that I suggest the other motorway entrances in Western Stuttgart (e.g. Vaihingen) Local people told us the same, too. But all in all, a good spot with many local cars which go about 50 km from here to South or East (on the highway).

This is a pretty good spot on Loffelstrasse to get to the A8. I got a ride here in about 30 minutes (1 male). It's normally a bus stop and it's really easy for people to stop.

Walk past the traffic lights and round the entry road. It's not perfect as some cars accelerate hard but it's possible.

As traffic coming from nearby towns is very light, you need to be here so you get all traffic combined together otherwise you risk waiting ages if you wait at traffic lights.

an average place to stop cars. the better place: head in the direction of the large MANN MOBILIA XXXL furniture shop 300 meters (less than a minute walking). there is a taffic light where cars stop safely. build a sign with A5 on in as well as your destination such as 'heidelberg' or 'frankfurt' or 'freiburg' or 'basel'. on my personal rating this spot here on the intersection gets only a ""6"". too many cars pass by as there is no safe spot to stop for them.

a BURGER KING restaurant as well as an older ARAL petrol station make it easy to 'autostop' from here north on the german A5 (direction karlsruhe as well as frankfurt and hannover/hamburg). you reach this raststaette (called 'weil am rhein') where plenty of drivers pass through easy and within 30 minutes from the center of basel. take the 'DB regional express' (one stop)from 'badischer bahnhof' (kleinbasel). walk over the tracks, there is a large road bridge, follow the road and the signs to the 'burger king' restaurant. while the trainride takes only two minutes, walking takes you more than a half. the place is very safe + easy to find.

Service station on German side.You can get lifts up north to Karlsruhe or further. Much trucks from South stop here to sleep overnight to go further north.

This is a small gas station on the A5 highway that is the main road to north from Basel. Everyone that wants to get north fast and needs gas starting from Basel will stop here.

Direction south on A5 (Mannheim/Karlsruhe/Basel) you can get to the Rasthof by foot. Get U6 to Heerstrasse (final stop) and cross Heerstrasse there. You must walk along the U-Bahn traks to the open field and continue the small road. Pass under the bridge and then up the hill. after a couple of meters you need to climb up on the right (i made that in April09, it was muddy, looked as if they are going to plant bushes there but there is a way to get through for sure). Like that you will get to the carpark. As its before Frankfurt you might aim for a lift to the next Rasthof, since that one is bigger and most people dont go that far. But i found a lift very easily like that. (Weekday morning at 10am) might also work for going north, but A5 leads into A7 and A4 afterwards, all the people i asked headed south!

WE dont recommand at all. It is easier to go to a rest area North of the city

I'm not exactly sure what I should put here... I got a ride in about 5 minutes with a sign that said, 'A5 Nord.'  There's a stoplight that backs up traffic for 1/3km, so you have a chance to look at nearly every driver in the eye to make sure they've seen you.  I got a lift very fast, but it could have been luck.

Then turn right where the traffic turns for direction of Mnchen, and hitchhike there while standing on the grass on the side. There is not a great place for the cars to stop, but they can always stop on the grass or stop for a second on the road if there is not much traffic.

Roads have changed. This marker is now near a nice spot on the upper level at the end of the departure gates. There is a spot on the road just after this where people can stop or they often just stop right in the road as everyone is doing it to drop people off anyway.

For direction Friedrichshafen you can either try right after roundabout or walk a bit further to the straight road before it meets the highway.

Try to talk to everybody in the ferry, because after getting land, cars just won't stop !!! The drivers who took me in Copenhagen told me it was better to stop there as they were going to Oldenburg. I guess if it's possible, don't get drop after the ferry because there are some rush and then nothing and most cars won't stop again. Plus, I was there in the evening, I tried for one hour. Then I decided I'll spend the night in the trainstation. It isn't the worst place for an overnight : it's covered, warm, you can hide, there is a train at 5am going to Lübeck. And it's a nice place to meet some frustrated HH :D

―Couleurmate (Hitchwiki), August 2014

I experienced that the closer you get to the ferry exit, the less speed the cars have (and thus the easier they can read your sign). This is much more to your advantage IMO than standing further, trying to catch traffic from the K49.

Great if you go north or south, hard if you look for a car towards Berlin. In my opinion it's always better to talk to people infront of the restaurant instead of standing with sign or thump.

Very bad if you want to go towards Bremen, probably quite good if you want to go up North. If you want to go to Bremen, instead walk towards the Eisinghausener Strasse (south, see map), walk along it with your thumb up, and catch a ride to the autobahn on ramp on the west of Lehr.

How to get there:
Take the tram line no 1 to Dietrich Bonhffer Strae. The station is south south west of the hitch point. Southwards trough the gardens until the next parallel street, then left to the station.

-Stand at the traffic lights. Lights are set so usually 5-6 cars stop at the red light, go through and then the next 5-6 cars have to stop. Plenty of time for them to decide if they want to give you a ride or not. Only thing here is that you have to pick one side so you miss a few cars.

OR

(Going South only)
-Stand behind the intersection right before the start of the highway. There's a spot where people can pull up. Thing here is that people are accelerating right where you stand (not so good).

tried for one day to get a ride to Czech, asked about 200 people, looked a long time for czech cars, it's NOT possible! and I think to berlin it's also not a good place. you may think it's a good spot because there are thousand cars but don't hitchhike here!!

Sometimes you can find Police in that station but don't worry they are not going to say anything even if you talk with the drivers. Good Luck

Bus stop. Well-known hitchhiking spot, good for all directions out of Frankfurt. Get here with Straenbahn line 16 or 17, or U-Bahn line U4. Stop is 'Festhalle/Messe' (50m away on the other side of the roundabout). You often find other hitchhikers here, especially in the morning. Waiting time 30-60 minutes.

We hitchhiked from here west to the airport Frankfurt Hahn. It was 10pm and so dark, and no cars slowed down or even looked interested for a good 45 minutes, thankfully we got picked up by the actual airport bus and given a lift all the way there, however i think we just got lucky, wouldnt recommend this spot for getting to frankfurt hahn.

Agreed²! To go north on the A9 either convince someone to go out of their way to take you to Feucht or if you get really stuck, go onto the A6 and cross the motorway at the 1st petrol station after Nuremberg (Kammersteiner Land, to cross walk about 700m east) and continue from there, it's a detour of about one hour but has worked very well for me.

Rastplatz Hohenlohe Nord

Hitchhiking on Sunday, August 28th was very hard (had to stay overnight) cause cars were full with traveling families and trucks are not allowed to operate on Sundays (except for freezers). However, this place is in the nice area and with plenty of space for camping at the back of the station. I recommend to talk with truck drivers - a lot of them are going to France and willing to take travelers.

I anticipated a fast pick-up ... however, it took over an hour to get a lift. To begin, there was a hitchhiking queue with a guy that didn't know hitchwiki!  That is awesome!  His sign that said 'A35 Bonn' was small, so when I made him a new sign, he got a lift in 10 minutes.

It took me another 15 minutes to get a lift from here.  Super easy since there's a lot of traffic.  I believe our wait time was just due to midday local traffic and a hitchhiking queue.  So, 4 stars.

One of the better spots to hitchike North or South via A9 from Halle (I couldn't find a good spot....). Lots of cars in this spot, but it's not a good place to stop for cars and pick you up - you will have to wait for a driver who doesn't care that he basically blocks the freeway entrance ramp if he/she picks you up :) Anyways, it has always worked out!

there is an ESSO petrol-station along A659 (eastward direction). you can reach A5 (via A659) within minutes. drivers at this place can take you to weinheim as well as heidelberg (south) or darmstadt (north) on A5. you can also ask just to get taken to another relais (petrol station) on A5. this station here is rather small. it is difficult to reach it from nearby 'rhein-neckar-zentrum'. take tram number 5 from the city center of mannheim to RHEIN-NECKAR-ZENTRUM (a shopping mall), walk on 'heidelberger strae' east, cross the autobahn over the bridge, and walk (illegal!) along it west towards the station again. it is possible, only 300 meters. on my personal rating from ""1"" to ""10"" (""1"" very bad, ""10"" perfect) i will rate this spot a ""7"".

―Anonymous, April 2012

after missing the allstedt fuel stop we ended up here. it's the absolutely wrong spot for going from east to west on the A38, because it's the wrong side of the autobahn (even though it's accessible from both sides). only old and young locals were passing there. the only chance is to find a mercy mitfahrgelegenheit-car-driver picking you up. usually they stop at the parking area in front of the macdonalds, that's a spot for them.

Gas station, but people going only to local destinations. Little traffic. People confused. I nearly died there.

I ended up there because driver thought that it is the  BAB Frankenhole Nord station which in reality is some 20 km further and this place is not on the map (at least not on mine) so it is possible to take this for other one. I was there on Saturday and it took me some 4h to get from there to west. A lot of place for camping though, that could be useful if you end up in this spot :)
