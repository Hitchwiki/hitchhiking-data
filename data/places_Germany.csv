Please just note: To get to the gas station you have to cross (illegaly) a field. On rainy days (so was mine) you may look dirty and full of mud. Well, I had to change my clothes, otherwise nobody would have taken me :D

―Anonymous, December 2014

Why cross a field, when there´s a road to each side of the service-area? I saw also someone crossing the motorway by foot to go on the other side but there´s a tunnel a little bit south which you can easy reach by foot.

It took me app. 20 min to get a ride torwards stuttgart.
most people i asked were from munic but still drove up north,
but still found a great ride ☺

―Anonymous, June 2011

my fav in dd (i live around the corner)! i hitchhiked very often to berlin from here. i waited from 1 minute (sunny weather) til 30 minute (heavy snowing). i often stand before the shell petrol station, but asking the drivers direcly at the petrol station is also a good idea. it's also a good starting point for going to leipzig, chemnitz and further west and south (bavaria, austria, italy, france, spain). you should ask for the raststätte dresdner tor near wilsdruff. there you can change the car easily.

in winter 2012 i waited also one hour or more - surprising. one day it was about 15 degrees celsius under zero (maybe people didn't want to open the door because of the cold). the other day was the day after a huge antifascist demonstration but only local elderly people were around. maybe the berlin antifascists didn't start early enough for my plans (2 or 3 pm)

Very good for A14 (north) or A2 (northwest - Hannover e. g.). A9 is difficult. A38 is risky - nearly no traffic and/or gas stations here, consider a detour.

―Santa klaus (Hitchwiki), October 2013

Resting place Muldental. Here is a patrol station and a fast food restaurant. It is the last big stop before Leipzig. From here you find people who want to go to north/south on the A9 or keep heading west.

Might be a bit tricky to reach from Berlin, Hauptbanhof. To get there take S7 in the direction of Potsdam and either take E23/33 from ""Wannsee"" or take the bus (ask the information office which number you have to take) to Michendorf Banhof and exit two stations after that station, then walk for about two kilometers and you are there.

michendorf, michendorf, if the world would be as easy to understand as 'michendorf rastanlage' everyone would love to live here! hannover, magdeburg, dortmund, leipzig, munich are to reach from this spot. you should definitely (!) wait for a driver that can take you all the way to your destination and NOT only until the next rest area (which might not be as good as 'michendorf'). if you need to reach the other side of the rastanlage (if you are only transiting berlin) you need to walk in the direction of michedorf village center (aks inside the station; they have local maps), walk underneath the 'berliner autobahnring' (200 meters east of the area) and follow the concrete way through the forest on the other side. this maneuver can take up to 30 minutes even though it looks shorter on this map. there is an ALDI as well as REWE market (open until 10 P.M.) in the center of the village of 'michendorf' (detour changing the sides of rest areas + shopping = 10 minutes).
again: my 'michendorf recommendation' is to wait until someone can take you to your day's final destination, don't just take the first car as this spot is excellent! on my personal ranking ""1"" (very-very poor) to ""10"" (excellent) i will rate this spot a ""9 to 10"".

For Switzerland I'd take any car to Bregenz, Lindau, Friedrichshafen, Konstanz (depends what side of Bodensee you want to chose).

Do not let drivers get you of the A96 into the Allgäu region (like Kempten). It's somewhat close, but you will have to take a lot of short rides from village to village to reach Bodensee eventually.

The girl that was driving was caring two people that were carpooling and one was going to Prague and I when at the same hostel(I didm't have one) and the driver brought us AT the hostel in the center of Prague seriously she waled in the hostel with us!!

to get to praha (prague, prag) on autobahn 'A 17' this is a good spot. you can stand underneath (or in front of-) the tall blue 'PIRNA - PRAHA' sign on 'B 170'. there is a curbside where the road bends onto the autobahn's on ramp, it is safe (legal) to stand there also safe for drivers to stop on the mentioned (cobbled) sliproad. you will know what i mean if you see it. to get there you can take the ??? bus from the city center which stops only a few hundred meters away or walk for around 30 minutes from the dresden DB main station via 'fritz-löffler straße', 'bergstraße', 'innsbrucker straße' and  'possendorfer straße' (do not follow 'innsbrucker straße' all its way but shortcut through 'kaitz' village). there is a noise protection wall between 'possendorfer straße' and 'B 170' but don't worry, there are doors to open in the wall. don't miss the view on elbsandsteingebirge from the B 170 bridge over the autobahn. on my personal ranking ""1"" (very-very poor) to ""10"" (excellent) i will rate this spot a ""7 to 8"".

Allertal is the last station before crossing A2. so if you want to go directing Berlin or Magdeburg/Leipzig you should get out here. most people are travelling to the south so it's not thaaat easy. but if you ask for Braunschweig you can get off at the next petrol station on the A2 in front of Braunschweig (Zweidorfer Holz). I've waited 10 minutes ;)

Allertal West; Extremely well used raststätte on the A7, due to its location on the stretch of autobahn where all the traffic to Hamburg/Bremen and Hannover/Rhein-Ruhr converge. To the north the A27 and A7 merge, to the south the A352/A2 and A7. Probably the best spot north of Hannover, stood here for 90 seconds trying to get out...

This is a perfect place for any direction, because there is a tunnel underneath the freeway. So you can switch from one side to the either.

'rastanlage hannover-garbsen' is an  excellent interchange between the autobahn linking germany from east to west ""A2"" and the north - south autobahn ""A 7"". i was hitchhiking from this spot to berlin in october 2009. you can change easy from one side of the autobahn to the other via a tunnel.  there is plenty of drivers that can take you. this place is so good, WAI for a car that can take you the whole way through to berlin, poland, hamburg or wherever - don't just take the first one...

Follow the street that is later called “Dammelsfurther Weg up to the “Pestalozziweg for maybe 500 meters and turn right. Now you pass the Autobahn and turn right again in the “Plantage. Follow this way a few hundred meters through the forest and you will see a service station on the right side. Maybe you have to climb a fence. Now you are on the a station without oil station but much traffic. Easy to get a ride here. Totally it takes approximately 40 minutes from the cologne main station.

'rastanlage auerswalder blick' is a good option to travel west- or estward on A4, direction 'hermsdorfer kreuz' (west, you can change from that relais/rastanlage to all directions) or east, towards dresden and the german-polish border. rastanlage auerswalder blick you can reach by bus from the city center of chemnitz and a short walk of 20 minutes. a tunnel 500 meters west of the relais (or a bridge another 500 meters further) lets you change the sides of the autobahn.

The Aral gas station directly at B3 direction South (Gieen, A5). If you're heading for the A4 (East) and feel short on time and traffic is low, consider taking the detour in the wrong direction on A5 to the rest station Wetterau, where you can reach the other side via a tunnel after the end of the parking area.

Easiest way to get to Maastricht is to find a driver going to Belgium or Eindhoven over the A76 in the Netherlands, then get out at A76 exit Geleen and hitch with sign Maastricht.

To get to Maastricht you can also find here any driver going to Heerlen-Eindhoven-Antwerpen, after crossing the border let the driver take the exit N281. Parallel road, the N281 has an exit Maastricht (with a petrol station at the beginning of the A79!). Then driver goes on on N281 towards his destination. This costs driver about 5 minutes extra driving time.

a good place to find drivers on A9 north as well as southbound, direction leipzig and berlin as well as nuremberg and munich. there is a traffic light and enough cars and trucks passing by. a nearby petrol station (aral) at 'schwabenweg' is not to recommend, only local traffic stops there. from this place you can also reach weissenfels by car within five minutes. at gewerbegebiet kaethe-kollwitz-strasse (ten minutes west, walking) there is a mcdonalds restaurant.

If you are going to Praha i think try first go to Pirna. Everybody going there. Or try with CZ table.

It's perfect spot in order to leave Dresden towards east. It's quite possible to find a car directly to Prague as well as to Pirna. We (two) wanted to go to Prague and waited just 3 mins with a Pirna sign. then, we left the car at the servis station just 1200 meters away from the spot. My suggestion is that firstly try to hitch Prague cars at least one hour. unless u hitch, show your Pirna sign and take a lift in 5 mins. It worths to try. It was 10th of August, 2012. Good luck ;)

Both fuel stations are north of the highway. I think people going from west to east are less likely to stop here than people going from east to west. Since you don't really have a nearby alternative from west to east it's still okay though.

―Kriechstrom (Hitchwiki), January 2012

i wanted to go from west to east on a monday afternoon in summer. even though the rasthof and fuel station is accessible from both directions of the A4 most of the cars stopping there went from east to west - it's on the ""wrong"" side. some car-owners, who seemed to go east, spoke only polish and russian. this place is out in the sticks and it depressed me basically because i waited there for 1:30 hours. depressing was the decay of the former hotel there, now a fitness centre, the lonely old prostitute waiting for a job, the weathered former sex-shop, the fucked up local guys sitting there all day long on their plastic chairs. never again!

If your driver goes south it is best to get off at the next exit, called 'Großkugel'. There is an Aral petrol station from where you can hitch to the city center OR you can take the S-Bahn (goes 2 times per hour, takes about 30 minutes to the main station).

If you get a ride from Berlin or from the South and you want to go to Leipzig while your driver continues along the A9, you can either get off in Schkeuditz or at the airport, where you can take the train (3.60€) and be in Leipzig in 10min. You can use the same ticket for the city transport for the next 2h.

Absolutely no luck there after dark. The bus stop should be better than the crossing though, as it is the only opportunity for drivers to stop next to the street. Only cars from a little village have to pass the crossing in order to enter the Autobahn, drivers from Kassel already enter the Autobahn on-ramp  before.

Also the name of bus stop is BIRKENKOPF, and is reached via line 52.

―LaZubi (Hitchwiki), March 2015

Took me quite a long time to get there from Hauptbahnhof (train main station), because I took S-Bahn 15, then Bus and walked about 30 min more. Nevertheless probably the best spot to get a ride towards West, I found a driver who took me to Rastplatz Rhonetal after some 15 min already.

―Anonymous, September 2015

For Chemnitz and the center of Leipzig, this is a very good spot. But for Kassel/ Göttingen we waited 1,5 hours. It was the thrid car to head this destination in this period of time. The journey from Leipzig took us very long as well. Pack some food and a good load of time for this one. 

―Anonymous, August 2017

Average rest area with just a WC. From my point of view a very good spot to get from Leipzig to any westbound destination. For near and easy things like Kassel or Gttingen or more advantageous aims like Southern Netherlands or Northern France this could be a gould start. The A 38 is from my experience a good connection to the west: very few congestions but still enough traffic to get away.

How to get there:
Take a train from Leipzig Central Station to Liebertwolkwitz Station (takes 15mins) and then just walk there (takes 20-30 mins) via ""Gropsnaer Strae"". Important note: This section of the Autobahn is fenced like many others. To finally acces the Rastplatz you either need to climb the fence (quite manageable) or bring tools.
As soon as I reached the area, I had a lift within 15 mins in sunday calm traffic.

Theres a bus stop-good for cars to stop. When heading north you can also take people driving south to drop you at the next service station (Rasthof Kassel,less than 5 minutes,has a bridge to get to the other side to head north again). Anyway it is a good idea to have a ""rasthof KS"" sign,so you might have a chance to catch a local lift you to the service station!

a busstop on 'dresdener straße' (L 3237) you can reach with you own ""hitchhiker's busline"" no (???) from the city center of kassel. cars on this road are driving here sometimes too fast, there is a lot of traffic and every third- or fourth car will continue its journey on autobahn ""A 7"" (north in the direction of 'göttingen'/'hannover' or south to 'frankfurt'). the busstop makes it very safe (for drivers) and legal (for you) to stand on. on my personal rating from ""1"" (very-very poor) to ""10"" (excellent) i will rate this spot a ""7 to 8"".

―Anonymous, July 2013

AVOID if you want to hh to MUNICH!!! most likely people wont head there because the ones coming from Vienna already took an other route. If you are willing to wait you might be lucky after a while. Try and ask people for Landshut or maybe even Deggendorf (and ask them kindly if they could drop you at the highway A92 to Munich). No petrol stations on this route though, only parking lots!

Take city bus no 10 towards Schalding rechts der Donau from the city center. Get off underneath the autobahn bridge (can't miss it) and walk up to the gas station via the service road underneath the highway bridge.

depends a lot on direction and time: Karlsruhe - no problem. If you want to get onto the A8 to Stuttgart, expect to wait a bit longer. Use a banner for that purpose and try to ask drivers with PF (Pforzheim) number plate...

Checking the road signs, there appears to not be any other service station before the road split in front of Karlsruhe. So better get off here or try to find an on-ramp at the crossroads.

Walk past the traffic lights and round the entry road. It's not perfect as some cars accelerate hard but it's possible.

As traffic coming from nearby towns is very light, you need to be here so you get all traffic combined together otherwise you risk waiting ages if you wait at traffic lights.

a BURGER KING restaurant as well as an older ARAL petrol station make it easy to 'autostop' from here north on the german A5 (direction karlsruhe as well as frankfurt and hannover/hamburg). you reach this raststaette (called 'weil am rhein') where plenty of drivers pass through easy and within 30 minutes from the center of basel. take the 'DB regional express' (one stop)from 'badischer bahnhof' (kleinbasel). walk over the tracks, there is a large road bridge, follow the road and the signs to the 'burger king' restaurant. while the trainride takes only two minutes, walking takes you more than a half. the place is very safe + easy to find.

Easily one of the worst locations I've ever waited at. Nobody seemed interested to pick you up. The station also doesn't get much traffic. A local car every few minutes on a Saturday afternoon.

One guy who passed by and smiled returned 15 min later and stopped and said that he never had any luck there and recommended to walk a few 100 meters further on to stand by the traffic light, where he eventually always had success.

We gave up as Flensburg was just so demotivating after coming for a great HH country (Denmark).

So, we were waiting here for an hour and a half without any result.

actually it should be a perfect place, but for some reason, i stood there for 1,5 h. I recommend you to have a big sign (so the guys at the traffic light can see you).

This is the best spot to pass munich to salzburg or up north. It is the last gas station before munich and a lot of people from the Bodensee Region are taking this way to Austria or the Balkan states. The route via Bregenz/Innsbruck is less popular. We needed 5min to get a lift to Salzburg and the guy who picked us up would have brought us even to vienna. The best way is to ask the people there.

Gasstation Schauinsland

OK traffic

You can get here from Freiburg by taking Bus No. 36 towards Hochdorf, exit Bus station Högestraße. Makes sense if you're trying to make a long distance. Otherwise you might just stay at Kronenbrücke, all together it will take the same amount of time.

Coming from the north it works the same, if you want to get to freiburg let them drop you out here, try to find someone who is going directly to freiburg or take bus no. 36.

bad place to start.. lot of cars going by but either they were unfriendly or didn't go to nuremberg. sign highly recommended, because people can still go everywhere from there. hard to focus on drivers with so much traffic zooming by, and I think quite some people didn't stop because it's not a good place to stop, although there is some space. I'll try a different spot next time. PS: lots of ants here!

―Micha (Hitchwiki), April 2014

Super good place, you will maybe need a little to find a car ( max. 1-2h ), but will get out of the city for sure. My fastest lift was straight to berlin in 5min, and the longest I had to wait 1:30h-2h something like that. My best experience is to only show your thumb, people will stop and you can ask them where they go. Signs like ""Berlin"" or ""Direction Berlin"" will only confuse them, since they think they can only take you if they go directly to Berlin.

―Yorick (Hitchwiki), May 2014

August 2014. Really good place. If you're going far north, it's better to have a sign that says A9 than your final destination. I waited for 30 min with a sign for Berlin, but got a ride after 15 min after switching to A9. The warning about the ants is legit. :D

I think this was the exact spot - right after the second long term car park, about ten minutes walk from the terminal. I was hhiking with a sign for Switzerland. Very few cars, but some stopped within 5 minutes and wanted to take me to Memmingen or Munich. In 20 minutes I got a ride to Zurich (the driver wanted 20 though). Another man was hhiking in front of me, trying to get to Ulm and had stayed there for more than an hour. Maybe I was just lucky. The sign with the Swiss flag definitely helped.

Excellent place to hitch north from Freiburg. Get here by taking bus no. 33 or 35 to Tiengen Bus stop Im Maierbrühl. Major traffic here, you won't have to wait long to find the right car. It's even worth taking the bus from freiburg which takes one hour alltogether. It's good to print out the way from the bus stop to the gas station though, or you'll end up with very dirty shoes.

There is not a great place for the cars to stop, but they can always stop on the grass or stop for a second on the road if there is not much traffic.

The two of us tried to hitch a ride in this spot, with no success. There are a lot of cars and their speed is not very high, but the cars on the outer lane (the one closer to you) are turning to the local neighborhoods on the roundabout and the ones you want to catch going to Berlin are on the inner one. We gave up after more than two hours and moved to the Caspar Voght Str. spot, where it was much easier. Already in the car, we saw another hitchhiker there going to Lubeck.

―Anonymous, September 2014

Very nice spot general direction south. It's a bit more difficult for straight direction west if you want to enter the Netherlands from the far north to Groningen.
Reasons: IKEA is just behind the spot and hence there are many people from all over the place to buy some furniture. This can also cause problems, when they are totally loaded.
How to get there:
Take either tram line no. 4 or 5 to station 'Huckelriede' then switch over into bus line no. 53 until the end (IKEA) or station 'Carl-Zeiss-Str.'
(one earlier). Be aware that you leave the city boarders, when using Bus 53. You'll need an area-extension if you don't want to dodge the fare.
Good ride and quick hitch,

Not a best place, as there is a lot of locals and the station itself is a bit far away /2 roundabouts) from A6 highway.
A lot of locals and trucks going to Strasbourg (surprisingly).

In one hour a german driver Herbert agreed to take us to Nürnberg. He couldn t speak other language, so I had to practise german (good!). When he was having a shower, we talked, ate and drunk with Hamid, a Persian driver (with very few english he knew and few Turkish words I remember). It was a wonderful communication.

Most of the cars going to Hamburg. I planned to go through Rostock on my way to Denmark, but this guy who looked really helpful offered me a ride to Kiel, so I changed my mind. On the way I have seen some other gas stations before the roads going to Kiel and Rostock split. So maybe you can accept a ride to Hamburg or Kiel at this gas station here, and you just ask for the driver to drop you off at one of the next gas stations where you still might find people going to Rostock, if that's what you want.

take a close look where the marker is exactly positioned. there is other markers at the gasstation as well as closer to the on-ramp of the autobahn but i found to stand at the traffic light the best opportunity. if you are standing in front of the gasstation you have the problem that cars tend to speed up to 100 km/h even before they have reached the autobahn - at this speed people normally do not stop anymore for a hitchhiker. i have seen people standing there for hours - while i was waiting for five (5) minutes at the same day/time (to catch a berlin - hamburg driver). at the traffic light drivers have the time to decide to take you (- or not). the spot is excellent to reach the northern berlin surroundings, 'schwerin' or 'hamburg'. on my personal rating from ""1"" (very-very poor) to ""10"" (excellent) i rate this spot a ""9 to 10"".

Direction south on A5 (Mannheim/Karlsruhe/Basel) you can get to the Rasthof by foot. Get U6 to Heerstrasse (final stop) and cross Heerstrasse there. You must walk along the U-Bahn traks to the open field and continue the small road. Pass under the bridge and then up the hill. after a couple of meters you need to climb up on the right (i made that in April09, it was muddy, looked as if they are going to plant bushes there but there is a way to get through for sure). Like that you will get to the carpark. As its before Frankfurt you might aim for a lift to the next Rasthof, since that one is bigger and most people dont go that far. But i found a lift very easily like that. (Weekday morning at 10am) might also work for going north, but A5 leads into A7 and A4 afterwards, all the people i asked headed south!

you have to catch a driver who can pick you to this spot. If a driver doesnt go your direction, but opposite is also good, you need just take a walk 80m (or he can easily turn back also). Dont try to get there from trian station by foot (its 2km, and no a sidewalk, nor bicycle path)

better if you have someone, who can bring you there by car. otherwise you need to take the train to Nürnberg-Fischbach(every 20min. from N.Mainstation) and take a walk there (20min. side of the road). stand (with sign) right afer bridge. --> in the curve is plenty of room to park! 4/5 when you need to walk there, otherwise 5/5

two guys having a sign CZ. Almost nobody goes to CZ, because they mostly go through Regensburg, it would be a great detour to go through here. I believe that someone waited here 13 hours to get to Prague. Anyway, a guy stopped after 45 mins and told us he's going close to CZ. I thought he was taking A 6, but he took A9 and left us close to Hof, so we had to go to Dresden and then finally to Prague. But maybe we were lucky, because we could have waited here 24 hours to get a lift to Prague.

If you want to hitchhike from Nuremberg to Munich or elsewhere south and you don´t know nobody with a car -  this is my hotspot. Just take the S-Bahn Nr. 3 to Feucht and then you can walk to this servicestation - directly on the motorway (germ. Autobahn)Just follow the Schwarzenbrucker Straße and turn left (uphill) after the first bridge but befor the next railroad bridge. 

For me there is just one disatvantage if you are in a hurry - from the S-Bahn station Feucht to the servicestation you´ll need around 45 min.

This spot is good indeed for eastbound traffic towards berlin or into the northern periphery of Magdeburg. Please DO NOT TRY THIS SPOT FOR WESTBOUND TRAFFIC. That might seriously ruin your trip.

Great if you go north or south, hard if you look for a car towards Berlin. In my opinion it's always better to talk to people infront of the restaurant instead of standing with sign or thump.

OR

(Going South only)
-Stand behind the intersection right before the start of the highway. There's a spot where people can pull up. Thing here is that people are accelerating right where you stand (not so good).

Try to talk to everybody in the ferry, because after getting land, cars just won't stop !!! The drivers who took me in Copenhagen told me it was better to stop there as they were going to Oldenburg. I guess if it's possible, don't get drop after the ferry because there are some rush and then nothing and most cars won't stop again. Plus, I was there in the evening, I tried for one hour. Then I decided I'll spend the night in the trainstation. It isn't the worst place for an overnight : it's covered, warm, you can hide, there is a train at 5am going to Lübeck. And it's a nice place to meet some frustrated HH :D

―Couleurmate (Hitchwiki), August 2014

I experienced that the closer you get to the ferry exit, the less speed the cars have (and thus the easier they can read your sign). This is much more to your advantage IMO than standing further, trying to catch traffic from the K49.


―Bipkip (Hitchwiki), July 2015

Be sure to be ready for when the ferry arrives: a big rush of cars comes by, but then nothing for the coming half hour until the next ferry arrives. Good place to stop a car;

I don't really agree with the spot made for hitchhikers. To much traffic and the pedeastian crossing is not really made for stopping cars. On the other hand I got of in 35 Minutes.

I hichhiked here to go to Szczecin (Stettin); quite remote place, but if you find a lift to this place it's not so bad: there is a traffic light, so cars slow down a bit more. As you see from the arrows, you catch all the cars coming from the city and from both directions of the Berliner ring.
The remoteness of the place, then, stimulates car drivers to stop, because they'll think there's something wrong if a person walks on that road.

Direction: Hannover and generally central Germany. Very nice place right next to the autobahn. Just make sure you stay before the blue sign (otherwise illegal) and don't stay behind the bridge pier. It's too dangerous and drivers see you too late.
How to get there:
Take the tram line no 1 to Dietrich Bonhöffer Straße. The station is south south west of the hitch point. Southwards trough the gardens until the next parallel street, then left to the station.

Not that many cars here, but then again there was almost nobody on the highway neither. I do believe this is a good spot because it's already in Germany so cheaper fuel. We decided to hitch cars on the highway too, but  managed to get a ride to Zgorzelec (PL) from the gas station after a little over half an hour.

Difficult to hitchhike. Lots of hitchhikers, you will usually meet someone, you need luck beacause traffic is small and cars are usually going somewhere in near.

Average spot to get a ride to the circle autobahn (A10), if you're in a hurry. Not easy for cars to stop, you have to get in during the red phase of the traffic lights. Most of the cars will stay in town, but sometimes you get lucky and people will stay on the autobahn to get out of town, in which case you can ask them to take you to Michendorf (huge petrol station at the A10), from which you can go basically everywhere (south, west).

Agreed²! To go north on the A9 either convince someone to go out of their way to take you to Feucht or if you get really stuck, go onto the A6 and cross the motorway at the 1st petrol station after Nuremberg (Kammersteiner Land, to cross walk about 700m east) and continue from there, it's a detour of about one hour but has worked very well for me.

THIS is the aral gas station. I used this place several time to get out of Freiburg. You can easily reach it by taking tram #1 and hop off at Brauerei Ganther.
Both directions (south to Switzerland and north to Karlsruhe and Frankfurt) are possible there! Just talk to the people when they fill up their car. Good luck!

it is only a small petrol station but just 5km west of the border to austria. its the last chance to get the vignette here before austria (people need a vignette to travel on austrian highways) and so it makes it very good spot to find a lift in direction east (Linz, Wien) a bit harder is it to find someone to the south (Villach, Italy, Slovenia) but it is also a doable thing here

There's a big parking area, a hotel, a restaurant and a petrol station.

―Anonymous, September 2017

This is an awful spot. Its pretty off the highway and has connection to north, south AND west. After over one hour of having no chance we got a ride in the wrong direction and took a trian wich was a really big mistake. Anyway let them not drop you off there!

The fuelstation has closed in southern direction(northern it's as it was). There is still a parking lot and I had luck with a truck driver, but, coming from Göttingen, you better ignore this station imho. (next on A7 is Hasselberg).

Can confirm the above comment, our driver told us the same. If you come from the A44 it's better to get off at Bühleck.

Generally ok if you want to catch a ride south but not ideal if you want to want to go west on the A44. Rather get out a station before..

Août 2014. Seul, je n'ai jamais été pris après plus de 4 heures d'attente, pluie et froid au rendez-vous. Je me suis tristement résolu à prendre le train.

J'ai essayé avec un carton indiquant CHEMNITZ. Puis j'ai essayé sans carton. J'ai testé les deux bretelles d'accès (il y avait beaucoup de place pour s'arrêter sur cette autre bretelle mais presque pas de trafic)... Rien à faire. A croire que les gens ne comprenaient pas ce que je faisais là (d'après les signes qu'ils me faisaient en tout cas).

August 2014. Alone, never pick-up and stay here for 4 hours with rain and cold. I took the train after this long time of wait.

I eventually got a ride to Mnster after about 1,5 hours standing next to the B67 close to the traffic lights (not at the exit/onramp, but the crossing of Bocholter Strasse/Im Geer).

After having been here for the 3rd time trying to get a lift to the A2 towards Magdeburg I can confirm it is much harder than going north. While lots of people would have taken me towards Hannover, Hamburg or Bremen, there were few going towards Braunschweig in the first place. 
You can accept lifts to Braunschweig or Wolfsburg, there is a gas station at the A39 with almost no traffic, but better chances to get a lift further east. 

―N0id (Hitchwiki), September 2013

Although it seems perfect for the direction north to Hamburg, it's not recommendable to get to A2 in the direction of Berlin. If you're coming from A5 rather choose A4 and A9 to get to Berlin.

Having hitchhiked via Frechen very often I don't like this place. There is always lots of local traffic going to the restaurant here. The fuel station is barely frequented. And it's just not a nice place. However it's the last petrol station before cologne when coming from west. If you can, try ""Aachener Land"" (60km west) instead.

Maybe it is not the fastest hitchhiking spot, but still you can catch quite easily someone going into the east to the Frankfurt. And as a bonus there is wonderful view to the Köln ;-)

―Xkomczax (Hitchwiki), November 2011

After getting through here a few more times I get the impression that the service station is good towards Frankfurt (A3), okay towards Hannover and Berlin (A1 and A2 later) but very bad towards Erfurt and Dresden (A4).

Two of us needed to wait for 30 mins to get a lift towards Frankfurt (A3). A good spot

With a big city and several directions just ahead, it can take some patience at Frechen to find the right lift.

parking spot with toilet ""goldene aue"": going west this place seemed to be totally deserted. very few cars passed. to go away from here we had to convince a local driver that we are lost if he wouldn't give us a ride. he took us to the next parkplatz which was similar. 200 m west is a bridge over the autobahn and a hiking trail to the small village thrungen, the village berga, train station ""berga-kelbra"" and lake kelbra. from the train station you can go to kassel in 2 hours, halle in 50 min, nordhausen in 15 min. (the last direct connection to kassel starts at 18:08 pm and costs 26,40).
but the landscape is absolutely beautiful! surrounded with hills you see the kyffhaeuser mountain. a sign informs about the interesting historic sights near here. i can imagine starting a hiking tour here. there's the beautiful lake kelbra very near on the other side of the autobahn.

Mostly locals and very little traffic. With a bit of luck you find somebody going to Hamburg.

Gas station called Neubucher Stadt, on the way to Lubeck. The gas station looks all right, there are a few trucks, but no one travels further than Lubeck. We spent there around 15 hours and in total, there were maybe 50 cars that stopped, almost all of them locals. Ended up begging for a lift to Lubeck and then hitchhiking on the ramp in Lubeck to continue to Hamburg.
